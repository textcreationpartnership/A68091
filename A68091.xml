         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Amongſt all the notable places in which this may bee moſt clearely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, that of the prophet <hi>Micheas</hi> is one, in the ſeuenth Chapter of his Propheſie,<note place="margin">Mich. 7</note> where moſt lamentably complaining of the corruptions which then raigned, he bringeth in God, ſpeaking after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:9089:7"/> 
                  <hi>VVoe is me, for I am as the ſummer ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therings, and as the grapes of the vintage, there is no cluſter to eate, my ſoule deſired the firſt ripe fruits.</hi> The which wordes ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth as much, as if he ſhuld ſay (I thirſt after righteouſneſſe, and am deſirous to ſee ſome good man amongſt the Iſraelites) euen as one paſſing by being thirſty, doth deſire to finde ſome cluſters of grapes, or ſome frute, but all is conſumed as it commeth to paſſe, in a drie and bad ſeaſon. Afterwarde he addeth, <hi>The good man is periſhed out of the earth, and there is none righteous among men, they all lie in waite for bloud: euerie man hunteth his brother with a net. The beſt of them is as a bryer, and the moſt righteous of them, ſharper then a thorne hedge, &amp;c.</hi> And continuing that ſpeech, it may very well be gathered, as well by thoſe words which wee haue recited, as by thoſe that follow, that euerie one ſhould turne from his crooked way, and returne to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of his dutie. If we will ſpend but a little time to conſider this deſcription of vices, and compare them with the ſins of our age, wee ſhall finde, that our age doth farre exceede, for ſo much, as not onely the fulfilling of all the filthineſſe of ſinne
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:9089:8"/> (of which the Prophet dooth ſo much complaine) may be ſeene amongſt vs, but it doth ſo ſuperabound, that in auncient times, feare and ſhame (which are two ſtrong bridles to retaine men in ſome ſort in their dutie, or at the leaſt to make them aſhamed of their faults) at this day are broken, and take no more place, but that which is worſe, they are by an incredible wickedneſſe of men, turned into a kinde of diſordered licentiouſneſſe, that euerie one is ſo paſt ſhame, that he committeth ſinne with a certaine pleaſure and delight of the heart, in ſuch manner, that he thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it not to be euill. Darkeneſſe is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted light, black white, and at this day there is no vice nor vertue, but that which men hardned and inuetrate in all kind of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, do eſteeme to be vice or vertue. For vertue, godlines the feare of god, charity, and ſuch like, are ſo diſguiſed &amp; varniſhed by the ſottiſh opinions &amp; fooliſh ſpeech of worldly men, that they are reckoned to be vice, hypocriſie, diſſimulation, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether contrarie vnto that, which they are indeede in themſelues: and the ſame vices, couetouſneſſe, ambition, enuie, ſtealth, robberie, blaſphemie, rapes,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:9089:8"/> whoredomes, murder, ſedition, mutinie, and many others, are ſo gallantly ſet forth with outward masks and paintings, that they paſſe at this day for vertues, woorthie of perpetuall commendation, in ſuch ſort, that euen as when wee ſee in the woods or forreſt, Beares, Lions, Wolfes, they put vs in a great feare, but when wee ſee them emboſſed, or portraied out vpon a wall, or vpon a gate, we take a certaine pleaſure to behold them: Frogs, ſerpents, ſnailes, &amp;c. are lothſome and diſpleaſant vnto vs whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſee them creepe vpon the grounde, to leape vpon, and to crie after vs, but when we ſee them liuelie drawne vppon a fayre table, or wrought with the needle vppon ſome carpet, diſtinguiſhed in one place with white ſilke, in another place with greene, red, violet, or crimſon: Or when we ſee there theſe venomous creatures ſet foorth with ſuch varietie of colours, wee take maruailous delight to beholde them, and we do admire at the ſame. Such is the behauiour of the moſt parte of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the earth, who, although there be nothing more deformed and monſtrous then vice of his owne nature, nothing which may make men more to tremble for
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:9089:9"/> feare, if her filthineſſe might be ſeene as it is, nothing is to bee founde more filthie, more noyſome or inferiour, nothing more peſtilent and contagious then her poyſon, of which the Kings, Princes, and Potentates of the earth, Kingdomes, Countryes, &amp; all Prouinces, are empoyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and all perſons of what tongue, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, nation, ſo euer they bee, are ſo bewit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ehed, that wee may verie well ſay, that it is as it were an outragious ſtream that hath drowned the whole world. Howe manie may be found at this day ſo filthie in their corruption, Ruffians, Whoremongers, Bawdes, and a number other of the ſame ſtampe, who by theyr ſugred words by their honyed diſcourſes, and by a deceitful tongue, full of ſophiſticall gloſings, doo make men thinke and beleeue, that wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vices, which draw vpon men the curſe of God, vntil it caſteth them downe head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long into the gulfe of hell, are not ſinnes, but pleaſant paſtimes and recreations. And that they which follow not other mens ſteppes, who maketh conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of their wayes, and wil not proſtitute themſelues, and wallow as ſwine in the dirtie puddle of the corruptions of this
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:9089:9"/> world, are counted fooliſh and ridiculous: in ſuch ſort, that we may in our word fitly call our age a cleanſing ſinke of all filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, &amp; vncleanneſſe of the times paſſed: what then is to bee done? Verily euerie one muſt endeuour, that as the world was neuer more ingenious to find out a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand kind of deuices &amp; ſubtilties to couer their ſinnes, to bee ſo deſirous of an holie reformation, that he bee as quicke witted in inuenting and diligently ſearching out all the moſt ſoueraigne and excellent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies,<note place="margin">As the world was neuer ſo corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: ſo all poſſible means muſt be deiuiſed to remedie the ſame.</note> by which in ſome ſort ſo many e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils may be met withall: the feruent zeale which we ought to beare to the glorie of God, ſhould ſtirre vs vp, that loue which is due to our neighbour, ought to pricke vs forwarde, and manie other reaſons which were too long to recite. When we feele our ſelues ouerladen, and ſurchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with infectious humors (as the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians tearme them) and they cauſe the paine of the heade, of the ſtomacke, or of anie other part of our bodie, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentymes a diſtemperature of the whole, wee goe to the Phiſitian, wee aske his aduice what Medicine wee ſhall vſe, wee take it verie willinglie, that which
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:9089:10"/> hee appoynteth agreeable to purge vs, ſometyme ſweete, ſometime ſower. If one helpeth not, wee take another, if the ſeconde haue no operation, wee make other compoſitions, potions, confections, pilles, vntill wee haue found out that which purgetth the putrified and corrupt humours of our bodie. VVhen anie is taken with an extreame and daungerous diſeaſe, hee hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the Phyſitian for the ſame, he asketh counſaile of him, howe hee may knowe the meanes to heale his mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, or to mittigate the ſharpeneſſe thereof, hee prayeth him to applie all the force of his Arte, all his beſt receits, if one Doctour cannot helpe, he ſendeth for others, earneſt intreatie is made for the patient: To bee ſhort, one runneth in poſt hither, and thither, to finde out thoſe that be moſt expert and perfect in that ſcience of which they make profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to the ende they may ſteed them in this vrgent neceſſitie the like are we to do in a ſtrange and fearefull ſickneſſe, with which miſerable men are diſeaſed: wee muſt not only apply medicins, &amp; old plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, for they will do no good, the diſeaſe
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:9089:10"/> is ſtronger then they, but we muſt deuiſe new medicins which are of more force the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe that haue bin vſed heretofore, other wiſe there can no hope be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment or recouery.<note place="margin">Diuerſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions of ſome, to correct the corruptions of our age.</note> Many think that the moſt ſouereigne &amp; effectuall remedy is, if kings and princes ſhould reforme the bad behauior of the court, and for that as much as the ſcripture teacheth, that God poureth forth his indignation vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> people and nations, &amp; doth iuſtly puniſh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the ſins of the kings of the earth. This is a moſt forcible reaſon, for in truth, euen as Emperours, Monarches, and Kings of this world, do excell others in power, riches, credite and authority, ſo alſo ought they to ſurpaſſe others in all kinde of vertues: as wee ſee in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, that as the Sunne is greater then all the other ſtarres, ſo it doth farre ſurmount them in brightneſſe. If it commeth to paſſe, that kings do exceed others in vice and diſorder, what may bee expected of the moſt part of the ſubiects, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly follow the example of their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but that they delight in corruption, and eſtrange themſelues from God? As in the contrarie, if Princes giue themſelues
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:9089:11"/> to the ſtudie of vertue, and that it ſhine in them as it ought, wee may conceiue hope, that there light will kindle others to follow them. Neuertheleſſe, this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is not of ſo great weight, becauſe God manie tymes doo giue good Kinges, yet their Subiects are not bettered ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by: and as ſometymes there may bee a good people, but a wicked King, who is nothing amended by the honeſt life of his Subiects. VVherefore we muſt conclude, that this dooth depende vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the prouidence of GOD, who as hee holdeth the hearts of Kinges in his hande: ſo likewiſe, the heart of the people, to learne and encline them whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſoeuer hee pleaſeth, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that is not the true meanes, or neareſt waye to purge the worlde of ſin. There be others that are of opinion, that all men in generall, and euerie one in particular, muſt beginne to bee diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with their ſinnes. For God hauing created all creatures to bee knowne of them to be ſerued and worſhipped as the Creator, if it ſhall come to paſſe, that man which being <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi> chiefe of the works of god,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:9089:11"/> in ſteede of keeping the firſt ranke, in ſinging and celebrating his praiſes, ſhould not acknowledge him, but diſhonour and blaſpheme him, ſeeing that other inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our creatures do praiſe and magnifie God, performing that vnto him, vnto which they were principally created: it is not to be doubted, but that this intollerable and deteſtable vnthankfulneſſe in man, will prouoke the curſe of God vpon mankind, and ſuch deſolations, that as a floud ſhall couer all the earth. But if euerie one could amend himſelfe, and vnfainedly deteſt his wicked life, and addict himſelfe to the knowledge of God, to ſet forth his praiſes, as they are bounde by the lawe of nature, and of their creation ſome hope might be conceiued, that the earth in ſome ſort ſhould be reformed. But becauſe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people is a filthie beaſt, blockiſh, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, following their owne fancie in the manner of their life, who will neuer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue that which is not anſwerable to their owne affections, there is no likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of reformation and amendment of life in this reſpect. Moreouer, earthly Princes enioying their pleaſures at the full, attended by flatteters, who often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:9089:12"/> do commend all their actions, and hauing none about them which dare o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen their mouth to tell them their dutie: what hope of reformation may be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued or looked for in this regard? we muſt then ſeeke out ſome other meanes, by which in ſome ſort wee may attaine vnto the ſame.</p>
               <p>Many haue written very excellent trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes of thoſe means, which are maruailous notable, worthy diligently to be read, and to bee practiſed, by reaſon of the great force &amp; efficacie that they haue, to moue euerie one to the performance of his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. But in our opinion, all things being conſidered and examined with ſounde iudgement, the moſt exquiſite, moſt ſoueraigne, and forcible remedie, to renue as much as may be the face of kingdoms, full of all abhomination, filthineſſe, and horrible vices, and in one word, ſo intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled one with another in an infinite ſort of ſinnes, that they are as huge mountains that reacheth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the center of the earth, euen vnto heauen, crying for vengeance, (as the ſinnes of <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha</hi>) the moſt ſoueraigne remedie I ſay, is to procure a good number of paſtors, endued
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:9089:12"/> with vertuous &amp; honeſt maner, of ſound knowledge, and of a ſingular dexteritie in preaching the word of God, and of a true and ſincere zeale to the glorie of God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with diligence and watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the adminiſtration and execution of their charge.</p>

For if they be impure in their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, burning with couetouſneſſe, ambition, enuie, hatred, rancor, giuen to drunkenneſſe, looſeneſſe, to an vnchaſte life, or ſuch like, and in their doctrine be heretikes, ſciſmatikes, and not of the true faith: their manner of life and doctrine do ſhine alſo eaſily in vs, who do naturally drinke in more pleaſantly thoſe potions which be venimous and empoiſoned, then thoſe which bee good and wholſome. Wherefore in the name of God, and by the guiding of his ſpirit, we will ſet downe in this treatiſe with arguments and reaſons, as forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as poſſible may be drawne out of the holy ſcriptures, as well the manners and holy life, which ſhould ſhine in them, as the ſuffiencie of that learning, with which they ought to be furniſhed, and eſpecially the meanes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

                  <note place="margin">1. Tit. 3 Vnder the word ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie or dignitie, are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended all thoſe nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble titles with which the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth ſet forth the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, vnder the word hard, all difficulties.</note> ſeeing <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

                  </hi> is painfull &amp; full of trouble. And this is that which we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly ſay, that thoſe things which are rare &amp; excellent, are for the moſt part hard to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto. <hi>Cicero</hi> in his firſt book of offices, would ſignifie no other thing, when he ſaith, the more that any thing is hard, the more it is excellent. And in another place, where hee ſaith, that Nature her ſelfe hath inwrapped great things within great difficulties. But to vnderſtand theſe two poynts more eaſily, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der each of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we comprehend al that which the ſcripture ſetteth down, touching dignity and labor: that is, vnder the name of dignitie
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:9089:21"/> we vnderſtand all thoſe excellent titles, with which Paſtors are adorned in the worde of God, the which titles appertained in ancient time, to the Prophets, Prieſts, and Apoſtles: not that it is our meaning to ſay, that in al things paſtors be like vnto prophets, prieſts, and Apoſtles, without any exception: we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue vnto them that which was proper and peculiar vnto themſelues, and which cannot be giuen vnto them which nowe preach the word, as to the prophets to tell of things to come, the which God by an eſpeciall priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, hath reuealed vnto them by a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull maner: vnto prieſts to offer ſacrifice, and to performe other ceremonies, which were commaunded in the law: and to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles to be ſent hither and thither, into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places, to make plaine the will of theyr maſter, and to doo miracles, as they did, both for the confirmation of the doctrine of the truth: but we do onely attribute to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors that are nowe, all thoſe excellent titles which do commend their miniſtry, becauſe they are theyr ſucceſſors, in the publiſhing of the ſame worde, which alſo appertaineth vnto them by right, becauſe that the holy ſcripture doth honour them with the ſame ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles in many places, as wee ſhall ſee in theyr place, that vnder dignity and excellencie we put that they are called, <hi>Mimiſters of God,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:9089:21"/> ſeruants of god, &amp; of Ieſus Chriſt, Prophets, Me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God, Seers, Apostles, Euangeliſts, Doctors, Planters, Waterers, Diſpenſers of the myſteries of God, Meſſengers, Fathers, Biſhops, Salt of the earth, Light of the world, a good Sauour,</hi> finally: <hi>Angels, and Gods:</hi> all which titles we put one after <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

Alſo vnder difficulty, we comprehend the great trauaile and diligence which muſt be employed in that ſtudie, to doo beſt good in their charge, with moſt edifying: alſo all thoſe troubles and afflictions, which they vſually ſuffer, that is, iniuries, raylings, reproaches, dangers, vnto which they are often ſubiect, during the whole courſe of their calling. Let vs ſpeake then nowe of theſe two points, according to order, that is, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3</note> that it is a worthy worke: when he ſpeaketh thereof, hee maketh a little preface, to make them more attentiue, to whome hee writeth this Epiſtle, that they might the rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that hee intreateth there not of an ordinary or common matter, but of a graue and ſerious thing, as greater cannot be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. This is that which he touched in many
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:9089:22"/> of his Epiſtles, that alwaies when he entreth into a matter of great conſequence, to make the faithfull to know, that they ſhould deeply conſider that thing which he ſheweth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as in the ſame Epiſtle, teaching that Ieſus Chriſt is the Sauior and redeemer of the world: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſaith it, he vſeth this introductio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. This is a true ſaying, and by all meanes woorthy to be receiued, that Chriſt Ieſus came into the world to ſaue ſinners, of which I am cheefe.

Euen ſo, ſeeing that in the body of the Church, the Paſtors bee the eyes, and the light of the ſame, they that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be ſuch eyes, they ought not only with great care and diligence, to get this light, but hauing gotten it, charitably to preferre, and daily increaſe the ſame, to enlighten them that are in darkeneſſe, and breefely to take heed, that it be not diminiſhed and ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed in them, becauſe that if it bee quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched or darkened in them which deſire to be, or be already <hi>Seers,</hi> it is to bee feared, that it will bee the cauſe of as much miſchiefe,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:9089:29"/> as it would haue beene of goodneſſe, when others are directed by that light. But how commeth it to paſſe, that they come not onelie to bee bleare eyed, but darkeneſſe, and blindneſſe it ſelfe? This happeneth when they are puffed vp with pride, with carnal opinions, &amp; vaine fantaſies, with which they ſuffer themſelues to be led, &amp; lead with them all thoſe that hearken vnto them, vnto their owne deſtruction. Hitherto may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo bee added, that if thoſe that bee igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt, bee not kept backe from this charge, it will fall out by them, as it dooth by thoſe that hath badde eyes, and hauing a deſire to drawe neare vnto the Sunne, are offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the light thereof, and in daunger of looſing their ſight altogether: and that which is more to bee feared, through their negligence, (which beeing vnfitte, intrudeth themſelues into this charge) they do commit a double fault: that is to ſay, in that they ouerthrowe themſelues, and others guided by them: that they deſerue a double puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: becauſe of their want of experience, they knowe not howe to gouerne the flocke of GOD, the which they lead by Bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and Briers, and through deſart pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in ſteade of fayre wayes. Finallie, let vs conclude, that theſe two poyntes maye ſtirre vppe to the performaunce of theyr
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:9089:30"/> duties, that will bee <hi>Sheepheards,</hi> firſt the brightneſſe of that cleare light, which they ought to carrie: ſecondly, the indignation and wrath of God, which they heape vpon their owne heade, if they approach vnpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, and vnfurniſhed, of thoſe graces which are altogether neceſſarie for that calling.<note place="margin">Fift title, Men of god</note> Let vs come then vnto the fift, which is, <hi>Men of God.</hi> Wherein wee may note, that this title dooth ſeeme more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely to commende vnto vs their digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and excellencie, and alſo by this, they may the more liuely bee pricked forwarde to frame themſelues to the practiſe of their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in this calling. For the holie Scripture when it woulde ſignifie ſomething that is excellent, or when it goeth about to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute a certaine prayſe to ſome eſpeciall man, it vſeth the ſame manner of ſpeech. As for example: When it ſetteth downe a man valiaunt in the warre, it calleth him, <hi>A man of warre,</hi> as, <hi>The Lorde is a man of warre.</hi> Againe,<note place="margin">Exod. 25</note> 
                  <hi>All her men of warre ſhall bee cut off in that day.</hi> Alſo a notable man is called a man of renowme,<note place="margin">Iere. 49 Exod. 27 Iocl. 3 Dan. 2 Numb. 16 1.

Alſo it calleth, <hi>Men of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:9089:30"/> death,</hi> thoſe which are woorthie of death. <hi>Men of blood,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 26</note> thoſe which are bloodie min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. In like maner, Miniſters being honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with this title, <hi>Men of God,</hi> That is, to ſhewe, that this charge doth repreſent a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon more diuine then humane. They might as aptlie be called, <hi>Sonnes of men,</hi> to note, that they were the moſt rare and woorthie amongeſt men: but when God will haue his holie and reuerent name of man, to make knowne the loue and familiaritie, that thoſe which beare ſuch names, haue with God, and that that eſtimation which they haue with him, ſhoulde bee of force as nothing more to incite them which deſire this cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, hauing ſuch a title of glorie, and honor. For this as much in effect, as his domeſticall fauourites: vnto whome hee diſcloſeth euen the verie ſecretes of his heart. What man is ſo ſimple, or abiect, who will not think himſelfe greatly honoured, to bee in the ſeruice of any Prince, or great Lord, although it be but an inferior place? How doth he look aloft, who hath authoritie and credite vnder his Lord, and is fauoured of him? And beeing proude of this vaine honour, with what cheerefulneſſe, &amp; willingneſſe doth he ſerue his Lord? What doth he omit whereby he may gratifie him? What then ought they to doo, which haue this honour, to bee
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:9089:31"/> employed in the ſeruice of God, to bee ſo preferred in his houſe, that they haue not the name of a baſe ſeruaunt, but ſuch a name, as importeth the chiefe rowme of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count? What ingratitude is in them, who abuſe any wayes this ſingular fauour? and what puniſhment is hee woorthie of, that forgetteth his dutie? Wee conclude then, the feare which they ought to haue of bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing iuſtly puniſhed, if they faile in the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of their calling, and that degree of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour vnto which God hath exalted them, ought to ſtirre them vppe greatlie with all induſtrie and diligence, to applie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnto all thoſe thinges which maye pleaſe GOD, who is their true Maiſter, and ſouereigne Lorde. We ſet for the ſixt, that they are called <hi>Apoſtles:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">6. Apoſtles 7. Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts. 8. Paſtors. 9. Doctors.</note> for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth, <hi>Euangeliſts:</hi> for the eight, <hi>Paſtours:</hi> for the ninth, <hi>Doctours.</hi> And that they are called <hi>Prophets,</hi> by Saint <hi>Paule</hi> in the fourth to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> wee will ſaye no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: for it is plainlie enough layde open before.</p>
               <p>And as concerning theſe foure titles which are here ioyned together, wee will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound them all in one, and ſhewe what they ought to learne, who will exceede them in their places. Generally, they are to obſerue, that God hath giuen diuerſitie of graces vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:9089:31"/> them, to ſome more, to ſome leſſe, as hee knewe it to be expedient for the good of the Church: that is, that thoſe which were Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles (which hee put firſt) receiued greater a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of ſpirituall gifts, then the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts (which were after them) who had a cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a little inferiour to that of the Apoſtles. But the better to vnderſtand what the one and the other were, wee muſt ſpeake of each of them ſeuerallie. The Apoſtles were men tried, and choſen, whome God indued with moſt heauenly graces, and elected them in a ſoueraigne decree of honour: ſuch were the twelue Apoſtles, vnto which number Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was after receiued. Next were the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, becauſe their charge did draw neareſt to the Apoſtles, but they were vnlike vnto them in degree of dignine. As concerning Paſtors, and Doctors, manie thinke that it was but one office: but according to the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Caluin,</hi> they be two: who ſaith in his <hi>Commentarie</hi> vppon this place of Scripture, that Paſtors be thoſe, vnto whom is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the care of a certaine flocke, vnto whom alſo the name of a Doctor may not be giuen in ſome ſort, becauſe that the Doctors are thoſe which are ordained as well to make fitte Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, as to teach the whole Church. Let this the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be diligently marked, of all them <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  </hi> intend the profeſhon of the Miniſtrie, to take heed
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:9089:32"/> of theſe two extremities: the firſt is, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being <hi>Doctors,</hi> nor <hi>Paſtors,</hi> that is, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no gifts in any meaſure, to exerciſe this holie calling, that they ought not to goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to intrude themſelues. The other is, that although they haue ſome gifts for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of this charge, yet they muſt daylie learne to knowe their weakeneſſe, to the ende, that by the knowledge thereof, they may be humbled more and more: that when they ſhall perceiue their fellowe brethren and companions, to excell them in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and vnderſtanding of the Scripture, and of other ſciences, that they reuerence them, and giue honour vnto them, as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Veſſels which God hath preferred before them: and aboue all, that they bee free from enuying them. And hauing ſome opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of themſelues, they muſt not thinke that they doo ſurpaſſe them, but that they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge with humilitie to bee inferiour vnto them: and let them conſider, that if they bee not <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> yet they are <hi>Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts,</hi> and that although others go before them in gifts, yet neuertheleſſe, that they are thoſe whome it hath pleaſed God to appoynt to ſet forth his glorie: and that although others haue receiued more, yet they may be as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, according to that meaſure of riches which GOD hath beſtowed vpon them.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:9089:32"/> But if it commeth to paſſe, that thoſe which are not equall in giftes, ſhall ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to bee carryed away with enuie, which is verie familiar vnto them, who are drunken with a vaine and imaginarie ſufficiencie, they will cauſe more harme and miſchiefe in the Church of GOD, then thoſe will doo good, who beeing furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with all things neceſſarie, are promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to this charge. Breefely, ſeeing that God knoweth it to bee profitable for his Church, it hath beene and nowe is, his will and pleaſure, that there ſhoulde bee men endued with diuerſitie of graces, they that haue leſſe then others, ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themſelues with that they haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and endeuour to encreaſe them: that is, to followe them who haue more then themſelues, beeing touched with an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly iealouſie. And thoſe which haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued more, they muſt take heede to employe them as they ought, knowing that if they abuſe the ſame, they muſt render an accounte vnto him that hath diſtributed the ſame liberally vnto them, for the edification of his Church. Lette vs come to the tenth,<note place="margin">10. Planters 11. VVate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer. 12. Labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.</note> the eleuenth, and the twelfth, that is, <hi>Planters, VVaterers,</hi> and <hi>Labourers,</hi> the which in like manner we ioyne together, becauſe that they ſignifie
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:9089:33"/> as it were one thing. Behold then the frute which wee muſt gather of them of whom we ſpeake: that is, that euen as when labourers doo manure their lande, and order it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſeaſon, and as thoſe that keepe vineyards do dreſſe theyr vines, to the ende that they may haue plentie of fruite, ſo thoſe that deſire to haue the guiding of the Church of God, ought aduiſedly to conſider, that they bee ſufficiently prouided for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerment of the ſame: aboue all, to bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to inſtruct and teach, in plucking vp by the roots the brambles &amp; thornes which are verie thicke, weeding out as much as may be, the cockle, which groweth in great plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie with the good corne, and to cauſe it to bring foorth good and wholſome fruites, according to the expectation of his Lorde: and that they take heede, that through their negligence, it bringeth not foorth baſtard and wilde Grapes, in ſteede of good and pleaſant fruite. A ſimple husband-man, or ſome other ignorant labourer, will take all paines that hee can to reape the profite of his grounde: what ought then the labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of the Church of GOD to doo in the field of God? Is it a thing to bee ſuffered, that eyther by theyr negligence it bee mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, or by their inſufficiencie the profite thereof bee kept backe? Therefore after the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:9089:33"/> manner of labourers, they that deſire this calling, they ought principally to endeuour night and day to make themſelues fit for the ſame. Secondly, to ſette the good plant of the worde of God, to water it in good time, that it may bring foorth fruite in aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunce, and when the time of the harueſt and gathering is come, the labourers may reioyce, and cheefely the expectation of the Maiſter of the Vinyarde and of the fielde, may bee ſatiſfied, and haue occaſion to prayſe them, to whome hee hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the ordering of his grounde, that they haue dealt faythfully: euen as Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who calleth himſelfe and his fellow labourers, <hi>Planters</hi> and <hi>VVaterers,</hi> but it was GOD that gaue increaſe to his holy worke.</p>
               <p>Lette vs go forwarde to the thirteenth, in that they are called labourers with GOD,<note place="margin">Miniſters are called labourers with God.</note> this is, to giue them to vnderſtande, that honour which GOD giueth vnto them more particularly. For ſeeing that God can doo his owne worke himſelfe, who is ſo ſimple, that dooth not greatly wonder at ſo infinite bountie? Verily, it is ſo much the more to bee maruailed at, that wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing full of ſinne, are altogether vnwoorthie to come neere vnto him, not onely to bee the cheefe ſtones which ſhoulde bee em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:9089:34"/> in the building of his Church, but not woorthie to bee the leaſt, bee it neuer ſo ragged and vnhewed, vntill he ſquareth vs, to make vs fitte for his holy building. And not onely hee contententh himſelfe with that, but hee exalteth vs euen ſo farre, that wee are called his fellow-labourers. Alas, who is it amongſt all them that addict themſelues to the ſtudie of the Miniſtrie, that by the conceite of this mercifull kindneſſe, is not rauiſhed with admiration? And beeing thus aſtoniſhed, doo not ſtriue with all his power, to acknowledge this ſo ſingular goodneſſe, and plainely confeſſe, that all that hee worketh with GOD, proceedes not from his owne free-will, as ſome dooth imagine, but that all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from GOD, and that hee is nothing elſe but an inſtrument whome GOD ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vppe by his Spirite, to doo his will. When the Scriuener holdeth the hande of the Childe whome hee teacheth to write, the Scholler cannot well attribute the thing written, to himſelfe, but to his Maiſter which guided his hande: but the Maiſter, for the better encouragement of his Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, may ſay, that hee did write the ſame. Euen ſo <hi>Paſtors,</hi> they are nothing in the woorke of the Lorde but inſtruments, which are guided according to his will: but
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:9089:34"/> when they ſhall perceiue themſelues ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured of GOD, what ingratitude is it, if they doo forgette and abuſe this incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable honour? Who is it amongſt men, that beeing of an inferiour degree, ſhall not perceiue himſelfe greatly to bee eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, if hee bee called into the companie of ſome Noble Lorde, and that this great Prince will not attempt any thing, before hee hath made him acquainted therewith? and alſo will attribute vnto him parte of the glorie of his noble actes and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous exploytes which hee hath doone, although hee hath doone nothing, or leſſe then nothing, what vnthankfulneſſe ſhoulde there bee in ſuch an one, if hee woulde not make a vowe of perpetuall dutie vnto ſuch a Lorde, and ſtriue as much as poſſibly hee can, to pleaſe and gratifie him?</p>
               <p>The vnthankfulneſſe of them whome GOD hath called to the holie Miniſtrie, ſhoulde bee verie great, if they ſhoulde bee ſo farre gone, as to forgette that goodneſſe and title of ſingular honour, with which he hath adorned them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſuch ought to pray vnto God, to giue vnto them that grace, ſo to thinke of this honour, that the remembraunce thereof may bee a pricke vnto them, to ſtirre them
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:9089:35"/> to be diligent in the diſcharge of dutie. The fourteenth is, that they are called <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpencers</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Miniſters be called diſpenſers of the goods of God.</note> of the myſteries of GOD: this title may teach them two things: the firſt, that they bee faythfull in diſtributing the goods and riches which they haue receiued of God, they muſt take heede that they be not deſpiſed of them whome they teach: for this commeth to paſſe, the worde of God alſo which they deliuer, ſhall bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed, and God himſelfe: theyr Miniſtrie ſhall bee as it were vnprofitable, which is one of the greateſt miſeries that may befall them: becauſe, that euen as by the execution of their charge, Gods glorie is aduaunced, ſo by this meanes it ſhall bee diminiſhed, for which they ſhall bee coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table before God.</p>
               <p>To the ende then that they fall not into this inconuenience, they muſt watch night and day, to prepare themſelues to doo theyr dutie. The other is, that they fall not as it were, into the contrarie extremitie, that they regarde not too much to be praiſed of the ſimple people, who ſometimes for want of iudgement, when they perceiue ſome one to make a great ſhewe in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, and to haue gotten the fauour of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, they by and by imagine, that they bee
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:9089:35"/> men come downe from Heauen, and ſeeing that this cannot be corrected in the common ſort, they muſt beware that they giue not place to theſe flying opinions, to cauſe them thereby to waxe proud, and to be puffed vp. But they ought to remember, that they are onely ſtewards, and diſpenſers of the wealth of God, and not giuers, and diſtributers of that which is their owne, and when the time ſhall come, they muſt giue an account of their ſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardſhip, vnto him which hath placed them in that charge, of whome they ſhall be rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as they ſhall be found faithful, or vnfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. Finally, conſidering that if a Monarch, or King in this world, haue abaſed and pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led downe ſome one of his Seruants, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing charge of the diſpenſing of the goods of his houſe, haue ſo much forgotten himſelfe, that he thought them to bee his owne: how will God when he pleaſeth, handle them, if they doo not containe themſelues in all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtie within the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſe of their charge? Let vs come to the 15. that they are called <hi>Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Miniſters are called Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours.</note> and <hi>Meſſengers:</hi> what learne they by this? that euen as when Princes ſendeth their ſeruants into forreigne and ſtrange countries about their affaires, they ſend not ordinarilie thoſe which they thinke to be vnfit, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient to diſpatch their buſines, but thoſe which are of vndoubted abilitie: thoſe likewiſe
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:9089:36"/> that are ſent, doo endeuonr by all meanes they can, to make theyr Ambaſſage to haue happie ſucceſſe. The Kings theyr maiſters willeth, and maketh it knowne, that they will haue them to bee regarded as theyr owne perſons, that if they bee diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, they take the diſhonour to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, they are incenſed, and they take iuſt occaſion of reuenge, euen as <hi>Dauid</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged himſelfe vppon King <hi>Hamon,</hi> for that ſhamefull iniurie hee hadde doone vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Seruaunts, in cauſing theyr beardes to bee ſhaued, and theyr Garments to bee cutte: ſo in like manner, all they that bee meſſengers of the ſouereigne King of all Kings, to deliuer his worde vnto all ſortes of people, they ought not to ſpare any la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, to accompliſhe woorthilie the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of their commiſſion, that by the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pye execution thereof, they may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote in great meaſure, the worke of theyr Maiſter: And ſeeing that it is his pleaſure, that they ſhoulde bee honoured as himſelfe, as hee ſayth in the Goſpell <hi>(hee that recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth you, receiueth mee)</hi> they then, beeing mooued with this incomparable honour, to take more courage and alacritie to pleaſe him.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Miniſters of reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation.</note>Lette vs ioyne the other title of excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie verie like vnto this, which is the 16. rhat
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:9089:36"/> they are called, <hi>Miniſters of reconciliation:</hi> the meaning whereof is, that as it is meete, that they which are appointed to make peace, and ceaſe contention betwixt two or three, or a multitude of men, ſhould be wel ſpoken, &amp; to bring forcible reaſons to perſwade, and apply them to the purpoſe, that they may thereby cure the bitterneſſe of the hart on both ſides, and ioyne them togither in a firme bande of loue: euen ſo it is much more expedient, that thoſe which are interceſſors, and mediators betwixt God and men, ſhoulde bee prompt and ready to worke this effect: and it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie that they be wiſe, prudent, diſcreete, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed, endewed with good precepts and inſtructions, drawne out of the word of God, and other godly Authors, that by their great wiſedome and exquiſit learning, they may by the grace of God, reſtore poore ſinners (who haue broken in all points the league of allyaunce which God hath made with them) to the fauour of God againe. And that they doo ſtudy with all dexteritie agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to theyr calling, that when they pray vnto God, they maye make an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement betwixt God and the people, in the adminiſtration of theyr charge, according to thoſe meanes which hee harh ordeyned in his holy woorde:
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:9089:37"/> And becauſe this is verie profitable, they muſt labour to enrich themſelues, with all things neceſſary for the exerciſe of this office, of ſo great importance. Let vs goe to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther titles which are ful of waight and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. The 17. they are called <hi>Fathers,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Miniſters called Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> that as a good and wiſe Father, to whom God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen children, he taketh paine to bring them vp, and to inſtruct them, whiles they are in their young and tender age, in thoſe vertues, which ſhould altogither ſhine in them: when they are come to riper yeares, to frame them to other higher ſciences, to ioyne with their knowledge, honeſtie of manners, and ſo to breede them according to their naturall incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Thoſe alſo which are deſirous of the calling of the Miniſtrie, ought to beware, not onely to haue the bare name, and want the effect, that is, to be vnfit to teach the people: inſufficient to beat backe hereſies, which are oftentimes engendred in the middeſt of the Church of God: but that they be plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie inſtructed in each facultie, that making themſelues knowne indeed, they may be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of them who appoſe themſelues againſt that doctrine of which they are defenders, &amp; may be eſteemed of the people, ſo much, or rather more, then a wiſe Father is of his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie.

And that many of them which ought to be guided by him, are in continuall perill, and daunger. Wherefore all they that feele in themſelues, a certaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to carrie this light, they muſt remember that it is their part to walke in the ſame them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and conſider, that if they go aſtray, be it neuer ſo litttle, a great offence is giuen to the Church, in ſtead of edifying <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

In like maner, ſo ought they to take heed, that the doctrine of ſaluation, which they ought to preach which will exerciſe the miniſtry, be a good and ſweete ſauour, put into cleane and pure veſſels, or to ſpeak more plainly, to purge them of much filthines and many ſins, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto they are ſubiect as wel as others, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wel purified and ſanctified, they may bee veſſels more fit to receiue the ſweete balme of the doctrine of Ieſus Chriſt, and being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall plentifully endued, they may carrie it to euerie place, whereunto it pleaſeth God to ſende them, to embalme them with this pleaſant ſauour, which are infected with the corruption of ſin, &amp; that they may be as thoſe who being perfumde with muske, doo cauſe others to feele a ſweete ſmell when they are neere vnto them.

This ſauour of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred word of god, may much more be marred in men, who are ſubiect to ſuch change and inconſtancie, that we cannot comprehend the leaſt part therof. Beſides, there is Sathan, who hateth deadly the ſauor of this doctrine, who endeuoureth by his skill, ſubtiltie, and deuiſe, to cauſe it to bee loſt in them who carrie the ſame, or at the leaſt (beeing not able to burie it altogether) ſpitte out his venome to poyſon the ſame, that beeing mingled therewith, hee may cauſe it to be as vnſauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and hurtfull, as it is ſweet and profitable in his owne puritie. In one worde then, this title of ſo great prayſe, ought maruailouſlie to pricke forwarde them, who loue the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of the Miniſtrie, to be more diligent, and beeing entred, to exerciſe the ſame with faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe and conſtancie, notwithſtanding all thoſe hinderances and obſtacles that Sathan raiſeth vppe, to let their proceedings in their calling.

Lette vs alſo withall, conſider that there is no calling in the worlde ſo high as ours is, and lette vs knowe, that if wee ſuffer our ſelues to fall, there is no fall ſo daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous or ſo great. Wherefore ſeeing that we are preferred to ſo high a place, as aboue others, wee muſt alſo vnderſtande, that it is our dutie to walke in greater carefulneſſe and feare then other men, if that will aunſwere to the dignitie of our charge. And as we are

Secondly, the difficulties which are propoſed in teaching the worde of God This order is very good, for ſeeing that Preachers muſt not onely preach with the tongue and the mouth, but alſo with the hands, feete, armes, head, and in ſum, withall their bodie: that is, ſo gouerne themſelues in all their actions, that the practiſe of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine which they ſet forth, may be ſeene, and read, in the adminiſtration of their charge. It is expedient to handle firſt of all, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:9089:46"/> which are founde in the manners of Miniſters.<note place="margin">The firſt difficulties conſiſteth in this, that the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter muſt be vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proueable.</note> Before all thinges when Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſayeth, <hi>That a Biſhop muſt bee vnblame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi> who is it that will not altogether loath that function? For this woorde if it bee literally taken, as manie haue vnderſtood it: as amongeſt others, they which in olde time were called <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> who affirmed that the miniſtrie was vnprofitable, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the vices of the perſons: they were ſtraungely deceiued, in that they vnderſtood when S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>That a Biſhop muſt be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable,</hi> that it was required that there ſhould not be in him the leaſt blemiſh, and imperfection: ſeeing that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> by this worde vnderſtandeth not, that they ſhoulde be pure, innocent as Saints, or Angels, for ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they be men as others be, ſo it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, but that there ſhould appeare in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome reliques of ſinne, and naturall vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. It is verie true, that it is to bee deſired, that in thoſe which be ſuch men, that nothing bee ſeene to ſhine in them but examples of godlineſſe, and of all Chriſtian vertues, in which no earthly thing may bee perceiued: but ſeeing that it is impoſſible that they ſhuld be altogither vncladde of the olde ragges of our firſt Parent <hi>Adam,</hi> in vaine this is to bee looked for. Neither is this the meaning of Saint <hi>Paule:</hi> but onely that they
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:9089:47"/> be vnreproueable<note place="margin">VVhat it is to be vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proueable.</note> in regard of notorious of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, of all criminall caſes, that they bee not conuinced of infamous and ſhamefull ſinnes, for which they which commit them are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as to commit adultery, forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, murther, theft, briberie, or to haue borne falſe witneſſe againſt any man, &amp; ſuch like. For in truth, if any one being apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in theſe groſſe and palpable crimes, haue beene admitted to this charge, and that it bee knowne, it muſt needes cauſe great offences in the Church of God, ſeeing that the <hi>Paſtor</hi> ſhould not onely haue a good teſtimonie of thoſe that be of the ſame Church, but alſo of ſtraungers. But if it commeth to paſſe, that the <hi>Paſtor</hi> bee ſometimes a little intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in his actions, as if it chaunceth that he drinke more then ordinarie, or bee made angrie, or enuious, or ambitious, or tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with ſome ſuch like paſſion, which is not ſo well ordered as hee himſelfe deſireth, as to bee a little too much giuen to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite, to bee vnthankefull, troubleſome, hard to pleaſe, ſowre, too carefull, neuertheleſſe, hee taketh no pleaſure in theſe vices, and goeth about to extenuate them, and to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them euerie day, ſuch things hinders not, but that he may be vnreproueable. For if none ſhoulde bee admitted into the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie, but thoſe which are altogether voyde
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:9089:47"/> of ſuch infirmities, into which they often fall as well as others, it muſt of neceſſitie be concluded, that we ſhould haue no Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters at all. Wherefore the Donatiſts haue badly reaſoned, when to maintaine that the Miniſtrie of the worde of God ſerued to no vſe, they haue concluded, that no filthy and vnclean thing could be cle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſed by that which is vncleane. For (ſay they) Miniſters which ought to preach the word of God, and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the ſacraments, are defiled with vices as other men, wherby the Miniſtrie looſeth his force and efficacie: they are greatly (I ſay) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued: for beſides that, the reaſon before al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, is very ſufficient: it may further be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that neither the preaching of the worde of God, nor the adminiſtration of the ſacraments, haue no force at all fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the perſon of the miniſter, but fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ordinance &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God, ſeeing that he hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to this end. And we may obſerue hereby, that this reaſon is of ſuch force, that although a miniſter be wicked, and ſpotted with thoſe vices of which S. <hi>Paul</hi> would haue him cleanſed, and who was lawfully called, his impietie being vnknowne, his miniſterie ſhall not ceaſe to bee of power: the reaſon is, becauſe he exerciſeth his Miniſtrie, not in his owne name, but in the name of God, of whome dependeth all the force of the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:9089:48"/> Miniſtrie, whereof he is author alone. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, wee affirme, that although Saint <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> hath ſayd, that Baptiſme doth confirme remiſſion of ſinnes, and that the force of the ſaid Baptiſme, doth depende of the qualitie of the Paſtour, that this great Doctour hath erred in this poynt, as well as many others: which wee do of purpoſe ſet downe, to the ende that the authoritie of ſuch a perſon ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ulde not diminiſh the reaſon alledged by vs, the which we may confirme by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny teſtimonies of the Scripture, but this ſhall ſuffice, that when <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of Chriſt Ieſus, ſhewed the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Ieſus Chriſt, and baptized, In bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing, he ſayde: I baptiſe you with water, but he that commeth after mee, ſhall baptiſe you with the holy Ghoſt: for in ſo ſaying, it is all one, as if hee had ſayde, that it is not the Miniſter of the outwarde ſigne, but that Ieſus Chriſt is hee which giueth force, and vertue to his baptiſme, by the ſecrete and inwarde operation of his ſpirit. In like ſort wee may ſpeake of the word of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it hath the ſame reaſon, that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter can do nothing elſe but propound vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the people by a liuely voice, but god muſt giue vnderſtanding, &amp; imprint that which is ſpoken in their harts, to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to feele the power therof. He then <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  </hi> deſireth to bee a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:9089:48"/> he muſt take heed not onely to be pure and without reproofe of theſe groſſe &amp; noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious vices, but alſo of other lighter faults. For although it hath bin ſaid, that if a Miniſter be giuen to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit ſome ſmal offence, yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe he is without reproofe: our meaning is not in any ſort to flatter, or to make faults leſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are, whatſoeuer they be: for if he letteth looſe the bridle too much to thoſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of which we haue made mention before, and thinks that he ought not to be put by, in deſiring this charge, we ſay, that it is as dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable to God, as beeing polluted with ſome horrible &amp; infamous crime, yet neuertheleſſe is promoted to the Miniſtry, ſeeing that god vnto who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he muſt giue account of his charge, hath in as great horror thoſe vices which ſeem ſaml, as thoſe which are more apparant we cal theſe ſmall faults, as couetouſneſſe, ambition, enuie, and many ſuch like (becauſe they are ſo ordinarily eſteemed of men) but if wee ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer our ſelues to be caried too far herein, they become ſo great, <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  </hi> they be as viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſtreames, that carry vs before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into many downfals. Nowe let vs ſee thoſe miſchiefes which they procure to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, which run too far into thoſe ſins, <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  </hi> we may the better beware, &amp; alſo the beauty of thoſe vertues, which are deſired of a Paſtor to be followed, keeping the order afterward enſuing. When S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:9089:49"/> a biſhop muſt be the husband of one wife<note place="margin">How it is to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that a biſhop muſt be the husband of one wife.</note> (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that doth not properly appertaine to the matter in hand) yet neuertheleſſe ſeeing that S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſetteth downe a diſcription of the maner of a Paſtor, wee will breefely ſpeake ſomething therof. Although there haue been many that haue drawne out diuers expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons vpon this place, yet the beſt, &amp; that which is to be preferred before other, is that of ſaint <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> who ſaith, that heere plainly po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligamy is forbidden in a Biſhop, the which the Iewes held as a law in their time, of which they were not aſhamed, becauſe they were ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily drawn to giue way to the marriage of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wiues, being prouoked on both ſides: firſt whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they read in the old Teſtament, that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, Iacob, Dauid,</hi> and many other, had at one time many wiues, they might perſwade themſelues, that it was lawful for them alſo, as commonly it is ſeene, that there is nothing of more force to induce men to corrupt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, as the ancient cuſtome of our fathers and Predeceſſors. Secondly, looking vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Nations who were their neare borderers, how they were addicted to this natural deprauity, (as corruptions do ſtretch &amp; ſpread the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues eaſily vpon others) it is not to bee doubted, but that this ſinne likewiſe was rife amongſt the Iewes: for it is certaine, that the people in the Eaſt partes of the world, did not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:9089:49"/> marriage with ſuch religion, as did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come men of honeſt conuerſation. See then where S. <hi>Paul</hi> goeth about to teach vs, that if it be a villainous and diſhoneſt part in a ciuill perſon to be ſo intemperate, as he wil not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent himſeife with one wife, according to the commandement of God, how much more is that not only inconuenient but abhominable in him, which ſhould inſtruct others in the doctrine of ſaluation. In that it is required of a Paſtor, that he ſhould be watchfull,<note place="margin">VVhat watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of a Paſtor.</note> we may learne, that euen as they vnto whome anie charge is committed in this life, if they mind to bring it to good perfection, they muſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily watch ouer the ſame both day and night. Paſtors haue without all compariſon the greateſt and moſt troubleſome calling: they ought then to bee more diligent and watchful, if they purpoſe ſincerely and in the puritie of the conſcience, to diſcharge their dutie. Emperours, Potentates, gouernours of countreyes and prouinces, which are without ceaſing, to manage, graue, &amp; ſerious affaires, for the keeping in order of theyr ſubiects, and preſeruation of theyr eſtate, both in peace and warre, and at all times, they muſt not bee a ſleepe, but haue theyr eyes alwaies open, on the one ſide, and on the other, and more at one time then at another, according to the occurrancies of theyr weightie buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:9089:50"/> In warre ſouldiours do carefully keepe their watch and ward, although there be no likelihood of daunger: and this is a vſuall cuſtome which they keep amongſt them, but when the enemie falleth vpon them, they are more awaked then before: in ſteed of laying watch, &amp; paſſing ouer the matter ſlightly, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they bend all their force againſt him, beeing conſtrained therunto by an vrgent neceſſitie. Lette vs apply this to our purpoſe, Miniſters haue to deale with matters of greater impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance then thoſe which the great Lords of the world doo enterpriſe, for theyr affayres bee of the earth, thoſe of Paſtors are of heauen: it behooueth them therfore to be more watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full &amp; diligent. Souldiours do watch for their life, which they hold at greater price then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other thing, &amp; they endeuor by al dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to preſerue the ſame. But Paſtors hauing the charge of ſoules, which are by many degrees more precious then the life of the body, ſo they ought more to watch, but about what? ouer the ſoules which are giuen to them in charge, ouer the flocke of Ieſus Chriſt, that they may bee nouriſhed and fedde with the true and heauenly foode, that they may bee kept in the right way, and that they watch (I ſay) that they may more and more bee confirmed in the word of God, which is the true foode of the ſoule, and the true
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:9089:50"/> guide, to direct vs to eternall life. And alſo that they bee carefull that the leane diſeaſed ſheepe bee made fatte, and healed, and that the Woolues, Dogs, and Foxes, do not bite them, pinch them, nor catch rhem, within theyr clawes. And ſeeing that the Diuell, which is the true Woolfe and Lion, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes without ceaſing, puſheth at the fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and that Heretikes, Sciſmatikes, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially worldly and corrupt men, be like Serpents, who doo ſpie out continually (running more ſwiftly at one time then another, that they may doo hurt, turning and winding themſelues, the more eaſilie to ſeduce them) the Paſtor then muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that it behooueth him to bee more diligent to watch, then in a calme and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able time. When the couragious man of warre, which gouerneth a beſieged Towne, ſeeth a great breach to bee made, and that the enemie will make an aſſault, hee dooth more carefully looke about him, to giue the enemie the repulſe. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, when Sathan and his deputies dooth beſiege the flocke of Chriſt with furious aſſaults, they ought to ſhewe then, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues more valiant and prepared.</p>
               <p>To this ende Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calleth <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie</hi> a Souldiour. <hi>Thou</hi> (ſayth hee) <hi>Timothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, endureſt trauaile, as a good ſouldiour of Ieſus
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:9089:51"/> Chriſt.</hi> Wherefore if a miniſter in ſteede of being diligent, becommeth ſloathfull and cold in his dutie, &amp; through his negligence and looſenes, the ſheep committed vnto him go aſtray, or are loſt, let him propoſe to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe what hee ſhall anſwere before God, &amp;c. For the definite ſentence is giuen of God himſelfe, and is written in the propheſie of <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> in thoſe words which the ſpirite of God pronounceth by the mouth of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet: <hi>VVhen the watchman ſeeth</hi> (that is, the Paſtor) <hi>the ſword come vppon a land</hi> (that is,<note place="margin">Eze. 3. &amp; 13</note> the wrath of God) <hi>and that the watchman bloweth not the Trumpet, and the people bee not warned: if the ſword come, and take any perſon from among them, hee is taken away for his ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, but his bloud will I require at the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans hand.</hi> Behold a ſentence which is like a thunderbolt vppon the head of the Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the Church, if they fayle in their dutie, by which they ought the more to bee ſtirred vppe, by how much the puniſhment threatned againſt them is great, that if they diſcharge theyr dutie as they ought, they ſhall procure the greater bleſſing vppon themſelues, and vppon all theyr flocke, otherwiſe they ſhall bee brought into daunger, if they ſhall neglect and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe theyr charge. Lette it bee then concluded, that if it bee commaunded
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:9089:51"/> to euery faithfull man, to watch diligently, that hee bee not taken and intrapped by the nettes and ſnares of Sathan, &amp; by the crafty wiles of the world, &amp;c. By a farre greater rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the Miniſter who is ſet ouer others, ought diligently to watch.<note place="margin">Math. 24 25.14 Rom, 13. 1 Cor. 15 1 Theſſ. 5 2 Pet. 4 VVhat the ſobrietie of a Miniſter ought to be.</note>

The more ſimple and true interpretation is, that the <hi>Paſtor</hi> ſhould be ſober in eating, and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king: And it is to be noted by the way, that this ſobrietie is not a meritorious worke, to obtaine remiſſion of ſinnes, and the grace of God, as the Idolaters do eſteeme of their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brietie, not ſuch a kinde a ſobrietie of which mention is made in the Iudges,<note place="margin">Iudg. 13 Numb 4</note> and in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, where we reade, that thoſe that vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to obſerue the lawe of the <hi>Nazarites,</hi> did abſtaine from wine, and all ſtrong drink, &amp;c.

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:9089:52"/> burſt, and thinke that they ſhould liue to eat, and not eate to liue. The reaſon is, that this exceſſe, is wiſhed by S. <hi>Paul</hi> to be farre from a <hi>Paſtor,</hi> is ſo euident, that it is folly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund the ſame. Common experience doth teach vs, that a man that forgetteth himſelf ſo much, as that hee oppreſſeth nature by his gourmandizing, and ryotouſneſſe, becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not onely ſicke of the palſie in his body, but alſo in his ſoule.<note place="margin">The exceſſe of eating &amp; drinking, the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion both of Soule and body.</note> As concerning the body it is worſe then bruite beaſtes, whome wee may ſee, not to runne into ſuch exceſſe, as fooliſh men doo, who if they ſometime take too much, it is not in ſuch ſort, that they forgette their Caues, and dennes, that they cannot goe to them againe: but what happeneth to man? they doo ſo much ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time ouercharge themſelues, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not helpe their owne bodie, they can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther goe with their feete, nor touche with their hands.

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:9089:52"/> in this courſe of life) what do they feele in their poore bodies, but the intereſt, and cruel vſurie of their riotous life? that is, cruditie in the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, great paine of the head, wherby ſome become ſick of <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

In ſo much that S. <hi>Baſill</hi> ſaith: It is a great marueile that their poore body beeing ſo ſoftned, doo not melt as wax againſt the fier, &amp; that falling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by peecemeale, it bee not conuerted into duſt &amp; powder. To conclude, it is not onely the deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi> body, but the ſoule is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe as much hurt, as <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

                  </hi> they can do nothing wel, that when they are ſo diſguiſed, they cannot know their friends &amp; neighbors, no not their owne wiues, &amp; children. And to ſpeake more of this ſin, gluttony, and drunkenneſſe, doth onely hinder, &amp; ouercome the vnderſtanding of him that is drunke, but it alſo depriueth him of the counſaile of his freendes: For if they ſhall giue vnto them any aduice when they are ſo brutiſh, they ſpeake as it were to a ſtone. In ſome this gourmandizing and exceſſe, is ſuch a kind of intemperance, of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:9089:53"/> which <hi>Cicero</hi> ſpeaketh, which is the fountaine of all perturbations, that it is a reuolting, and an apoſtacy of the reaſon, and vnderſtanding: for it is ſo eſtranged from true reaſon, that it is impoſſible to gouerne, and containe by the ſame, the appetites, and concupiſences of the minde. Seeing then drunkenneſſe is the cauſe of ſo many miſcheefes which cannot be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, with good reaſon, S. <hi>Paul</hi> would haue this voice farre from a Paſtor, and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſide, that he be giuen to ſobrietie, which is the mother &amp; Nurce of an infinit company of vertues, which are too long to recite. And for this cauſe, S. <hi>Ierome</hi> writing to <hi>Nepotian,</hi> admoniſhed him to auoide the banquettos of temporall men, and that it were better for him to dine in his owne houſe, then in a Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace. And to make an ende of this point, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brietie beeng ſo much commended to all the faithfull in many places of the ſcripture, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters ought ſo much the more to embrace the ſame, by how much they haue the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ouer others.</p>
               <p>Let vs come then to the third vertue ſette downe by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> that is, <hi>Modeſtie.</hi>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, beſides the miniſters of the worde of God, who vnder the color of this hypocriſie, deceiued many people. But concerning true Philoſophers, perceiued ſuch kind of men to be amongſt themſelues, as this little hyſtorie beareth witnes. At a certaine time when <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> ſaw <hi>Anthiſtines</hi> the Cynicke, to ſeeke credite by wearing an olde Cloake, ſhewing in a bragge, the ragges which hee had, being deſirous to haue the ſame to bee attributed to his humilitie, counting it arrogancie in others that did weare better apparell: <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> ſayde with a loude voyce, <hi>I ſee thy pride Anthiſtenes, through the patches of thy Cloake.</hi> To produce examples of them, who make profeſſion of Chriſtianitie, who pleaſe themſelues in this hypocriticall humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, it were labour loſt: more of that ſtampe are to be found, then of anie other as euerie one that dooth but a little conſider the eſtate, may manifeſtly perceiue. But the Apoſtle doth earneſtly deſire true modeſtie,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:9089:54"/> and humilitie, which conſiſteth not in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the garment, neither in the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the face, and of the bodie, but in the mortifying of our diſordered and rebellious affections. This humilitie is the robe of the Miniſter, with which he ought to bee co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, becauſe (to ſpeake in one worde) that is the ſoule, the blood, and the heart of Chriſtian religion, and without which, reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is but a painted vizard. To bee briefe, ſeeing that this vertue is commaunded to all Chriſtians,<note place="margin">Rom. 12 Gal. 5 Phil. 4 Col. 3 Tit 3 1. Pet. 3</note> as wee may ſee in Scripture, it is moſt of all conuenient, that Miniſters ſhould put the ſame in practiſe. Wee will not then enlarge our diſcourſe of theſe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, becauſe they are ſo well knowne to all, but we will dilate more of thoſe things that follow, becauſe they are worthie diligently to be conſidered.</p>
               <p>The fourth vertue is hoſpitalitie, or charitie: where wee are to note, that the Greeke woorde which the Apoſtle vſeth, ſignifieth to loue ſtraungers, which is more then kindly to entertaine them, for they may bee receyued into our houſes, and wee may doo good vnto them, being prouoked by common courteſie, yet neuertheleſſe, not loue them, or if wee loue them, yet it is verie coldly. This ſheweth that chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and hoſpitalitie, which is here recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:9089:54"/> to Paſtors, towards the poore, and ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, it is not a diſſembled and ſuperficiall charitie, as was that of the hypocriticall Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſies, who gaue their almes, more to bee ſeene and praiſed of the vulgar ſort, then moued by the miſerie and pouertie of the needy: vnto this, tendeth that ſaying of ſaint <hi>Paul, Let loue bee without diſſimulation,</hi>

Verie eaſily: For many may bee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked to doo well vnto the needie, more to get a fame, and renowme amongeſt men, then mooued thereunto by the miſerie of the poore, becauſe that Ambition as the ſame Father ſayeth, is the Ape of Charitie, that is, as an Ape which is a pleaſant crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and well knowne to euerie one, vſeth to counterfeit what men doth, ſo an ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious man to get honour, doo force him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to doth the ſame thing, that charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men practizeth, as concerning the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde ſhewe, but there affection differeth
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:9089:55"/> ſo much the one from the other, as there is a diſagreement betwixt ambition and true charitie: for a true hoſt doth exerciſe cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, in regarde of the honour of God, who is the God of the poore, as well as the rich. The ambitious man reſpecteth his owne glorie onelie: the true hoſt is kinde to the diſtreſſed: the ambitious more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoureth the rich, then the poore: but that hoſpitalitie of the which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh in this place, is a true and naturall hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie, proceeding from the bowels of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, which is as pleaſing to God, as the other miſliketh him. This is that which is commended vnto vs by manye reaſons, which are too long to ſet downe, but wee will touch the chiefeſt of them, that wee may earneſtlye endeuour to practiſe the ſame.</p>
               <p>And firſt we are to call to minde the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of God in <hi>Deuteronomie,</hi>

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:9089:55"/> of great perſonages, to ſeeke the loue and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliaritie of them which are giuen thervnto, although they be their inferiors, and of lowe place in reſpect of the world: and by this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, thoſe which diſcend from great hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, doo oftentimes match with thoſe which are obſcure Behold an hiſtorie which beareth witneſſe hereof.<note place="margin">Gen. 24</note> It is recorded of <hi>Rebecca</hi> and <hi>Laban</hi> her brother, who hauing receyued courteouſlie the ſeruaunt of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who ſought a wife for his Maiſters ſonne <hi>Iſaac,</hi> it came to paſſe, by the ſingular prouidence of God, that <hi>Rebecca</hi> was giuen to wife to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> which was the chiefeſt good, that could hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to that houſe.

And this is that vnto which our firſt parents aſpired, who beeing without ſinne, commaunded all the liuing Creatures of the earth as a great King and ſoueraigne Emperour, this Empire did not ſuffice them, for as ſoone as the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell had ſayde vnto them, that if they did

And heereunto may be added, that the more excellent gifts we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue from god, which are proper, for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of our calling, the more ought we to take heede, that ſhee entereth not into our heart, to take poſſeſſion of the whole, &amp; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that theſe gifts bee the gifts of the ſpirit, which are the more to be regarded, as the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is more excellent then the body,<note place="margin">The higher that a cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is, the greater the ambition, if it creepes into them that exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that calling.</note> &amp; as they paſſe them in dignitie, ſo there is greater dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, that this worme of ambition ſhuld breed in them. We ſee commonly by experiences, that wormes doo not breede in new and hard trees, but in Cedars, and other more tender wood, and moathes in the fineſt wolles, &amp; not in the courſe: ſo likewiſe ambition is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per vice of thoſe that are moſt perfect. And this ought eſpecially to be conſidered, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt al the gifts of the ſpirit, there are none of more reckoning, then the graces of God in preaching the word, and as they are of more value, ſo ambition doth more attempt them
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:9089:67"/> which are endued with theſe graces, who are in perpetuall danger, to be ouercome of her, eyther by reaſon of their eloquence, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the conceit of their ſufficiencie: or becauſe of the general applauſe of the people: ſo that they ought diligently to beware <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

Choller then is ſo much the more daungerous, that it tranſformeth in ſuch ſort, the eſtate of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and minde, that if one could paint ſuch as are thus metamorphized, no ſuch monſters would appear. For chollericke men ſometime frowne, ſometime laugh, ſometime bluſh, ſometime waxe pale, ſometime they knock their feete againſt the grounde, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time they clap their handes, ſometime they mocke, nod their head, make a mouth, as chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren vſe to doo, and to bee breefe, they make ſo many faces (as one ſaith) as they that vſe to foote out the moriske daunce.

Some blame pleaſure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it transformeth men into ſwine, as <hi>Circes</hi> did the companions of <hi>Vliſſes.</hi> But cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler ought more to be diſcommended, becauſe it doth not onely transforme men into Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gres, and Lyons, which are beaſts more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, but alſo euen into the perſon of the Diuell, as we well obſerue in a learned trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of a famous man of our age, which hee made of choller, drawing theſe reaſons heere alledged to proue, that it depriueth vs of the ſpirit of God, by which we are regenerated: for if that ſpirit were in them, it ſhould make them of wolues, lambes, but choller bringeth vs to our ſauage nature, it cauſeth that of lambes we become wolues: and in one word, choller is the Prince of diſorder, which is in the world, and the true co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarietie, which op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth it ſelfe directly, againſt all that which God hath made. Briefly, ſeeing that this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is not only deformed, but alſo pernitious, thoſe which are preferred vnto, or deſire the calling of a miniſter, ought ſo much <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi> rather to baniſh the ſame fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, not only for the horrible miſchiefs which it bringeth with it, but alſo becauſe of <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>,</hi> ſpringeth another paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which is called <hi>Enuy,</hi> no leſſe dangerous and peſtilent vnto men then <hi>Anger,</hi> nay rather more, if all things be duly conſidered. We ſay
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:9089:69"/> that it ſpringeth of choller, becauſe it dooth communicate with it, as all vices depend one vppon another. But according to Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten,</hi> we may ſay that it proceedeth from Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, becauſe it is called the daughter of ambition: but ſo it is, that the parents being ſo neare, it was verie neceſſarie, that I ſhoulde touch ſome thing hereof by the way, becauſe they that are too much giuen to choller, and eſpecially to ambition, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly are infected with enuy. And this is that which S. <hi>Auſten</hi> would ſignifie,<note place="margin">Aug. de ver. b. dom. ſuper Mat.</note> ſaying: <hi>That Enuy is the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of pride, and that the mother thereof, which is ambition, cannot be barren, but that euerie place where ſhe is, ſhe bringeth foorth.</hi> Wherefore we may conclude of a certaintie, that hee that is ambitious, is alſo enuious. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſeeing that this paſſion, is as it were engraffed in the heart of euery one, euen as <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſaith, <hi>As there is no Larke without his creſt: ſo there is no ſpirit to be founde, in which there is not ſome ſeede of enuie:</hi> fo farre ought it bee from vs, to flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our ſelues, as though it were ſome little fault. For they which ſuffer themſelues to bee ouercome of the ſame, may commit an infinite number of ſtraunge ſinnes, the which are ſo much the leſſe tollerable, as this vice is more infamous and wicked then others.<note place="margin">VVherfore enuie is more infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous then other vices.</note>
               </p>
               <p>For when one is ouercome with choller,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:9089:69"/> with couetouſneſſe, with ambition, with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, for feare to offende, hee findeth out an euaſion, or ſome light excuſe, as when one is accuſed to bee negligent or ſlouthfull in his buſineſſe, hee will aunſwere, that he is to take aduice in his affaires: if an other be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended of impatience, hee will anſwere that hee ought not to diſſemble an iniurie that is offered vnto him, for if hee do ſo, hee may be alwaeis ſubiect to wrong. Againe, if an other bee reprooued, that he is giuen to pleaſure, hee will ſay, that hee muſt paſſe the time merilie, that he muſt be gallant, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe hee ſhoulde bee thought to bee a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholicke Stoick: if hee hee ambicious, hee will anſwere, otherwiſe none will reckon of him, vnleſſe hee bee aduaunced to honour and credite.</p>
               <p>To conclude, if he be couetous, he will ſay, that hee hath manie children to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and if he were poore, none would care for him, and if he ſhould grow to be ſicke, hee muſt depend vpon Phiſitians and Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, &amp;c. But if one aske the enuious man wherefore he is enuious, what can hee aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere? But that God is more good, more liberall, more mercifull, to giue vnto one more beautie, to an other more riches, to an other more knowledge. For when is an
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:9089:70"/> enuious man ſorrowfull? Euen then when hee ſeeth another man more furniſhed with ſome graces then himſelfe, hee reioyceth when another is grieued, and when he hath occaſion to bee grieued.

To be briefe, hee is healed by an other mans ſickeneſſe, and is reuiued by an other mans death. But let vs ſee by examples, the occaſions that the enuious take to torment, and crucifie themſelues. Wee reade,<note place="margin">Gen. 26 VVhat bee the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of enuie.</note> that <hi>Iſaac</hi> in the time of a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous famine, went vnto <hi>Abimelech</hi> King of the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> in <hi>Gerar,</hi> and that GOD hauing bleſſed his ſtore, in making his flockes of Sheepe and Cattell to encreaſe, and all that hee poſſeſſed: It is ſayde after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes in the Hyſtorie, that the <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines</hi> enuied him: where wee maye ſee an apparaunt matter of theyr enuie, which was that they enioyed not ſuch bleſſinges as <hi>Iſaac</hi> did: Wherevppon they made a great tumult, for the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled <hi>Iſaac,</hi> they ſtopped vp all his Welles, with which hee watered his flockes, and their rage was ſo great, that for to appeaſe and allay the ſame, <hi>Iſaac</hi> was conſtrained to depart from them. And the reaſon is added by <hi>Abimelech</hi> himſelfe, where hee

               <p>Let vs go forward, if this vice creepe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men of warre, or into Courtes, or into Kingdomes, or into the Church of God, it ſtirreth vp incredible miſchiefes.

               <p>If it creepe into Courtiers, it is neuer ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, but with the death of thoſe that it dooth enuie.

Amongſt other exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples we may read, that when <hi>Saul</hi> had a long time ſought <hi>Dauid</hi> to put him to death,<note place="margin">2. Sam, 21.</note> fearing
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:9089:72"/> leaſt hee ſhould gette away his Kingdome from him, it is there ſaide, that one of the ſeruaunts of <hi>Saul</hi> named <hi>Doeg,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to gratifie his Maiſter, came and tolde <hi>Saul</hi> that <hi>Dauid</hi> was in the Towne of <hi>Nob,</hi> and that the prieſt <hi>Ahimelech</hi> had giuen vnto him the Sworde of <hi>Goliah.

Then the gall and venome of enuie which was in the heart of <hi>Saul,</hi> aboundantly powred foorth it ſelfe, for hee cauſed not onely <hi>Ahime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech</hi> to bee ſlaine, but alſo foureſcore and foure Prieſtes with him, Alſo <hi>Nob</hi> the Cittie of the Prieſtes, ſmote hee with the edge of the Sworde, both man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, both childe and ſuckling, both Oxe, Aſſe and Sheepe, which were in the Cittie.

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:9089:72"/> by a moſt cruell murther of them which are ioyned together in conſanguini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: wee may propoſe two examples hereof, one of the Brethren of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 37.</note> of whome wee reade, when hee was deadly hated of his Brethren (becauſe <hi>Iacob</hi> theyr Father loued him, and alſo for his Dreames, by the interpretation whereof, his Father, his Mother, and his brethren, might vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that one day he ſhould bee preferred before them) his Brethren conſpired his death, and at length to ſatisfie theyr en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie, they ſolde him, in ſuch ſort, that theyr enuie was ſo violent, that although they knewe for certaintie, that he ſhould prooue a great Prince, who might afterward ſtande them in ſteede, yet they had rather haue putte him to death, then to haue ſeene him in ſuch an eſtate. The other may bee taken from <hi>Caine,</hi> who paſſed further: for the Hiſtorie maketh mention, that ſeeing the ſacrifice which hee offered, was not ſo accepted of GOD as his Brother <hi>Abels</hi> was, hee moſt cruelly maſſacred him. Moreouer, the enuious man doth not onely putte to death thoſe whome he doth enuie, but ſometime hee layeth violent handes euen vppon himſelfe, as ſome haue noted: and for proofe whereof, they haue ſet downe the example of <hi>Achitophell,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Sam 17</note> of whome

To be breefe, if an enuious man could ſet himſelfe againſt God, hee would doo it: and wee may verie well ſay, that enuie hath reached ſo farre in the perſon of the Scribes and Phariſies, and many others, of whome wee reade in the Goſpel, who although they were more then conuinced in their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, that Ieſus Chriſt was God, being ſo inchaunted with this poyſon of enuie, they deuiſed all meanes that they could to putte him to death, accuſing him, that hee ſayde he was God, and in the ende by this falſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation they crucified him.

And becauſe that Sathan, who is the true Father of enuie, and the mortall enemie of the ſaluation of men,<note place="margin">Enuie in the church hurteth as much as in any other ſtate.</note> endeuoureth with al his foce to increaſe his Kingdom, and to deſtroy Gods people, knowing that if there be any in whoſe heart this accurſed paſſion is planted and ingraued, it is in the heart of Paſtors
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:9089:73"/> whereby hee may gaine moſt, and the more aduance his kingdome, and diminiſh Gods inheritance. Then it may ſo fall out, that hee that is thus poſſeſſed with enuie, in ſteede of ſeeking the glorie of God, and the diſcharge of his dutie, hee will ſeeke his owne, neither will hee bee content to liue peaceably a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his fellow brethren, if hee ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that they excell him in any grace, whereby he may profite himſelfe, and learne of them, and that the Church may be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly edified, but he rather taketh delight, that both he and the Church ſhould be depriued of ſuch men, then patiently to beare, that the opinion which is conceiued of him, or which hee perſwadech himſelf men conceiue of his gifts, ſhould any way be impaired by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And to conclude, ſeeing there is no ſuch way to promote the glorie of God, as by the miniſtrie of his worde, prouided alwayes that thoſe that haue the charge ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, to preach the ſame, bee voyde of all ſiniſter and corrupt affections, and eſpcially of this enuie: ſo there is no inſtrument which doth more diminiſh the Kingdome of God, and eſtabliſh that of Sathan, as when the Paſtors ſuffer themſelues to bee car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away with theſe paſſions. Therefore wee muſt deteſt as much as poſſibly wee can, this horrible monſter Enuie, and to the

               <p>Theſe three poynts may bee verie cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gathered of that which Saint <hi>Paule</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in <hi>Tim.</hi> and <hi>Tit.</hi> where hee ſayth, <hi>That a Biſhop muſt be apt to teach:</hi> it is not meant that this qualitie muſt bee a thing forged in the ayre, it muſt bee imployed in the inſtruction of the people: and although ſaint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh not at all in that place, of the adminiſtration of the Sacramentes, neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, ſeeing that the adminiſtration of the Sacraments, dooth depende vppon the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the worde, hee that preacheth the worde, may alſo adminiſter the Sacraments:

And in the 41. verſe, it is ſaide, That they that gladly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued his worde, were baptized. And in the 46. verſe. They continued daylie with one accorde in the Temple, and breaking bread. Againe, when Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the 20. of the <hi>Acts,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 20</note> dooth reckon vppe the ſumme of his Apoſtleſhip, he ſaith vnto the Elders of the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> That hee kept backe nothing from them that was profitable, but had ſhewed them, and taught them openly, and throughout euerie houſe, witneſſing to the Iewes, &amp; alſo to the Grecians, the repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance towards God, and faith towarde our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.<note place="margin">Acts 26</note> And in the 26. <hi>Paul</hi> being before king <hi>Agrippa,</hi> did recount al his office, he ſaith, That aſſoone as euer he was called

It came to paſſe, that by the praier of <hi>Elias,</hi> fire was caſt downe from heauen, to conſume his Sacrifice, and on the contrarie ſide, that of the falſe Prophets was not conſumed, although they prayed to their god <hi>Baal</hi> to heare them, they were conuinced to be falſe prophets.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place, we reade in <hi>Ieremie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iere. 14</note> that the Prophet <hi>Ieremie</hi> by the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God, did confute the propheſies
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:9089:79"/> of the falſe Prophets, who affirmed that God would not puniſh <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> nether by the ſworde, nor by famine.

And in the 28. of the ſame Prophet,<note place="margin">Chap. 25</note> a certaine falſe prophet named <hi>Hananiah,</hi> ſhewing the people, that God had broken the yoke of <hi>Nabuchadnezzar <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

VVhen it it is there ſet downe, that <hi>Ieremiah</hi> had the worde of the Lorde to the contrarie, who by Gods commaundement, put him backe, ſaying vnto him in the 15. verſe of the ſame chapter: <hi>Heare now Hananiah, the Lord hath not ſent thee, but thou makeſt this people
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:9089:79"/> to truſt in a lie: Beholde this yeare thou ſhalt die.</hi> Wee reade likewiſe, howe that <hi>Ezechiel</hi> did beate downe the falſe Prophets and prophiteſſes, who ſeduced the people decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vnto them peace in the name of the Lord, then when hee was purpoſed to take vengeance vppon them for their ſinnes, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>VVo vnto the fooliſh Prophets, that follow their owne ſpirit, &amp; haue ſeene nothing.</hi> And in the 18. ver. <hi>VVo vnto the wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that ſow pillowes vnder all armeholes:</hi> that is, who maintain by their falſe propheſies, men in vaine hope, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing vnto them peace and quietneſſe, when they do abound with al wickednes. <hi>And make vayles vpon the head of euerie one that ſtandeth vp to hurt ſoules:</hi> that is, who fitte their vaine predictions to all ages, and to all kind of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or elſe they that do deck them which go towards them with cetrain vailes or ſuch like: promiſing them to obtaine by theſe meanes, any viſion. The Prophet ſpeaketh in ſuch maner, becauſe the ſorcerers and diuiners, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered with a vaile, the face of them vnto whom they ſpake, and ſowed pillowes vnder their armeholes, giuing them to vnderſtand, that the euent of their anſwer ſhuld be more certain.

                  <note place="margin">Act. 9.</note> And in the ſame booke we ſee, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> confounded the Iewes and the Grecians, ſhewing that Ieſus Chriſt was the ſonne of God.

But behold a great miſchief, <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi> word of God (of which none ought to ſpeake, but with grauitie and reuerence, is expoſed to laughter: for when the people heare an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned Paſtour, and him that is vnfit to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide the worde; manie times they mocke him, and laugh him to ſcorne, and in iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting at him, the worde of God alſo which is ſhewed by him, is ſported at, and baſelye eſteemed, by which they doo prouoke the wrath of the Lorde vppon themſelues. The other is, that hee is ſcarcely able to giue a

Wherefore to auoyde ſuch miſchiefes, let him which deſireth the miniſtrie, indeuour to frame himſelfe for the diſcharge of his dutie.</p>
               <p>He muſt here alſo diligently take heede,<note place="margin">To be apt to teach, &amp; to diuide the worde of God, hee muſt take heed that he heapeth not vp ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things without iudgement, which can not be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, and ſo he become ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure in ſpeaking.</note> that hee falleth not into an extremitie, as it were altogether contrarie, which is not to bee too learned (for a man can neuer learne ſufficiently) but my meaning is not to heape vp manie things, and gather them one vppon another vndiſcreetly, and without iudgement, in ſuch ſort, that hee cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe them, when neceſſitie ſhall require: ſo that ſuch which giue themſelues ſo to ſtudie, are commonly ſo confuſe and intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate in their diſcourſes, that the beſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned can hardly vnderſtande what they ſay.

<pb n="171" facs="tcp:9089:89"/> of the good or bad tranſlation, &amp; more eaſily find out the truth. To ſpeak particularly and ſummarily of euery one of them, we wil ſpeak firſt touching the Latin tongue, that nothing is more profitable then the ſame, and that for an infinite company of reaſons: eſpecially for this, that it hath bin in vſe in all ages (&amp; is yet at this day) as <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi> domeſticall &amp; mother tongue of al nations, ſo that they that are ignorant of the ſame, muſt needs be depriued of <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the moſt parte of thoſe things which are written in it. As concerning the Greeke and Hebrew to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, although many do not giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to the ſtudy of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as they do to the latin, &amp; ſome other that make no reckoning therof (not knowing it may bee, what value they are of) yet neuertheleſſe they be of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailous vſe. The Hebrew tongue is aboue all, neceſſary for the vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of the old te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, principally, becauſe it was firſt writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in that language: and the Greeke is no leſſe neceſſary, ſpecially for the Newe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was written in that. But wee may here note dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly two points touching theſe two tongues, that as each of theſe tongues haue their diuers properties, ſo we muſt diligently obſerue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if that we will haue the true and right vſe of them. The Greek tong hath this property, that it is ſo fruitfull and plentifull, this it ſignifieth one and the ſelfe ſame thing by many wordes, the which (beſides many
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:9089:90"/> other ſignifications which the ſame words may haue, according to the diuerſitie of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and matters, which do occurre heere and there) ſignifie alſo one thing, &amp; in this reſpect great heed muſt be taken hereof, that we doo not miſconceiue in ſearching the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of euerie place. As touching <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi> Hebrew tongue, ſeeing that it hath a propertie quite contrarie to the Greeke (becauſe it hath ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie fewe words, but vnder the moſt parte of them, it comprehends many &amp; diuers things) wee muſt conſider, that if we take in hand to expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſome places of ſcripture, we muſt not content our ſelues with one or two ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of euery word, but that we do diligently marke the pluralitie of the ſignifications of each word, according to the occurrences of matters: to the ende that wee may carrie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the moſt proper ſignification of the place, as neere as may be: ſo that he that can obſerue this, and practiſe it, he may be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailouſly eaſed in the expoſition of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: but contrariwiſe, he that ſatiſfieth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with a ſimple and bad ſignification of the greateſt part of words, without conſidering the varietie of euerie ſubiect, it is certaine, that although ſome one may attaine vnto a great knowledge in theſe tongues, yet he may be deceiued (as many are deceiued, &amp; do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly in going no further)
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:9089:90"/> that thoſe that haue only a mean knowledge in them, doo obſerue with iudgement this diuerſitie, as often as they ſearch out the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of any place. The ſecond point is, that it is not ſufficient for a Preacher to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain vnto the vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of thoſe tongues and to obſerue this diuerſitie: but alſo after that he hath found out a proper ſignification, he muſt ſtudy with dexterity to expound the ſame, with profit &amp; edification to the people. For if he want this dexteritie, it is certaine, that the knowledge which he hath gotten in the languages, is much leſſe profitable, (as it may be ſeene in many, which are deſtitute therof, although otherwiſe they haue experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the tongues) and for this cauſe, not onely the ſimple people, but alſo thoſe that haue more profited, are much more mooued and edified with ſuch kinde of teaching, then with the barren and ruder manner, as commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> experience ſheweth. And in truth, euen as it is not ſufficient to ſay, and to ſhewe, that ſuch a meate is good, or ſome other thing is very profitable, if order bee not taken for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioying of the ſame: ſo it is not enough for the Preacher (who is to inſtruct a congregation compounded of duers ſorts of men) to tell ſimply <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi> meaning of ſome place: but beſides, he muſt know how to ſet forth the ſame, and as it were to apparell it with neceſſarie orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:9089:91"/> that the people may the better finde it out, and be better edified, which alone with the glorie of God, hee muſt propoſe before him. Wherefore to conclude this firſt point, the Preacher muſt ſtudie with all diligence for this, to attaine vnto his ſoundneſſe of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, aboue all, in reading the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture without ceaſing, meditating in the ſame vppon all occaſions, pondering the ſame day and night, if poſſibly he can, propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding before his eyes that notable ſaying o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But my meaning is, that euery one ſhuld haue a good &amp; true vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi> things the which he will commit to memory, for if one learneth <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi> which he doth not vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, behold three inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueniences <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:9089:92"/> them: the ſecond, that after he hath learned them as it were by force, and conſtraint, hee forget them eaſily againe. The third, beeing in the memory, they doo more harme then good, becauſe that the places in the ſame me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, which are poſſeſſed with ſuch things, cannot be filled with other more profitable knowledge.</p>
               <p>But the greateſt hinderance that it cauſeth, is, that it hurteth the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in performing her duties, which is to approoue, or diſalow of thoſe things which be in the memory, or of thoſe things which we reade. For to iudge well of any thing, it muſt bee firſt well vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood: if our memorie be ſtuffed with thoſe things which we vnderſtand not, our iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall remaine idle and vnprofitable. But on the contrary ſide, if the veſſells of our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie be filled with thoſe things, it is incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible to be ſpoken, what frute and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie groweth thereby. We ſay commonly, that we onely knowe that which we keepe in memory,<note place="margin">We knowe onely that which we keepe in memorie.</note> which indeede is very true, becauſe that to iudge wel of knowledge, we muſt not accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that to be knowledge, but that which we haue learned in the reading of graue and ſerious matters, in moſt approued authors. For althogh men according to their wit, do deuiſe an infinit number of good &amp; excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t things, yet they muſt be praiſed for knowledge, by
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:9089:92"/> others, and indeed they be not many times of any account, but to be ſuſpected, both of our ſelues, and others. Moreouer, there are ſome that alledge other reaſons of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, which they may oppoſe to ours, which is the cauſe that ours are nor currant with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whether we diſpute with them, or whether we labor to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them in any thing. Furthermore, if we ſpeak any thing of our ſelues, which is ſound and forcecible, <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  </hi> is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly reckoned feeble, vnleſſe it be fortified and maintained by the reaſons of other men, which peraduenture we haue read, or vnderſtood, by our ſelues. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we can aledge <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

By this then, an incredible profit groweth to the preacher, that amongſt many other things, he may expound the word of God ſoundly,<note place="margin">Hee that hath a good memorie, may ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, &amp; eaſily preach the worde of God.</note> and plainly, according to <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

                  </hi> in the church of God, there be of all ſorts of men, both ſubtil &amp; groſſe, &amp; ſimple, others of ſome meane conceit: others of verie litle reach: the greateſt dexteritie of ſpirit that can be in a preacher, is ſo to apply himſelfe to euery ones capacitie, as that they may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed. And moreouer, the more that a prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher can frame himſelf to be familiar &amp; plaine to euery one, the more fitte he is to diſcharge that function: and which is more, he ſhall bee eſteemed the more learned. Although many be of a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie iudgment, who do not eſteem knowledge according to facilitie, but rather by I knowe not what reports of ſome, who eſteeme many to be learned men, which haue only the knowledge of ſome nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe,

And in truth, what man of iudgement wil account him a learned man, who is ſo obſcure in his diſcourſe, that he may be iuſtly carped at? And thoſe alſo, which do think to cauil, ſhall not know well them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with what they ſhould find fault: who I ſay, will account the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for learned men, ſeeing <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  </hi> they are learned only for themſelues? Theſe bee they of whom it is ſaid in a common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe, that their ſciences are hidden Muſes, but ſuch as are of no account, becauſe that ſuch men hauing ſome good gifts of God, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe, if others cannot be the better for them, they cannot be properly eſteemed for the greateſt learned men becauſe that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is not to be counted knowledge, when a man keepes it to himſelfe alone, and cannot impart it to others. But when a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which doth many good, and that he can
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:9089:95"/> eaſily co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi> ſame, he is fitly to be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a learned man. And it is very wel ſaid by an heathen Poet, <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi> it is nothing to know any thing for it ſelf, vnleſſe another knoweth that which thou knoweſt, as though he wold ſay, that otherwiſe it is not to be eſteemed for knowledge. But ſeeing that the marke and principall end of all knowledge, is to inſtruct and to edifie, it followeth that the more a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in vttering his knowledge, doth teach and benefit others, the more learned he is, and ought ſo to be accounted. Wherefore let vs conclude this point, that a Preacher ſhould not onely endeuour, to ſtirre vp his minde, and poliſh his tongue, with faire words, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,<note place="margin">The more plainly a man writes or ſpeakes, the more learned is he to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted.</note> and delectable, but alſo, and principally, to fill his breaſt with the knowledge of many good and profitable things.

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:9089:95"/> and ornaments without ſententious words, and to ſpeake ſententiouſly without order and diſpoſition of words, it is childiſh. Finally, let vs adde, that a preacher being ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently furniſhed both wi h words &amp; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, of many good things, he ſhal attain vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an eaſie kind of teaching, &amp; hauing attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

                  </hi> which he thinketh to be moſt expedient, &amp; the beſt way to edifie: ſo we may alſo ſet down our iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in this point. Neuertheleſſe, we may boldly ſay, that the method which wee propoſe, is not to be diſcommended, becauſe we know by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that the practiſe therof, hath done very much good. For hauing preached ſome ſmall time in 11. or 12. churches, in many of which, ſome learned men were preſent, which were greatly edified, &amp; principally in thoſe chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches which were in three or foure vniuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in which were many doctors, and a great number of ſtudents in diuinitie, verie well learned, who with many others, perceiuing how profitable it was, deſired to haue it, and to bee made acquainted with the practiſe: ſome haue craued it at our hands, and others
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:9089:97"/> haue very importunately intreated vs to ſette it foorth in Print. And ſeeing that our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is to prepare to the Miniſtrie, thoſe which are deſirous of this treatiſe, (and that it is neceſſarie aboue all things, to bee well furniſhed to preach, which is the principall parte of this charge) by this occaſion, wee haue obeyed vnto theyr lawfull requeſts, more by conſtraint then willingly, prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting before God, and in our owne conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that in this, we haue no other regard, then of the glorie of God, and the edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church: as wee doo aſſure our ſelues by the iſſue of this our enterpriſe, that the one and the other,<note place="margin">The prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher muſt not haue a vaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</note> ſhall bee greatly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered. And this we doo cheefely ſet down, that euerie one may ſee that wee are not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular in our owne opinion, which we haue placed afterwarde, for a long time, knowing wel, <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  </hi> there is nothing that ſo torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth the mind of the ambitious man, nothing which is more hard to keepe, nothing which more hindreth the way to vertue, and in ſumme, nothing is more peſtifferous and contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in any man, then this is, and eſpecially in him that deſireth our charge. And I will adde this alſo to the reaſons before alleaged, for what cauſe wee haue written this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod: that is, hauing layde the foundation thereof, vppon the Sermons of many great
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:9089:97"/> preachers, whom we haue heard in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, being very diligent in hearing them, and after meditating vppon their Sermons, haue broght the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into writing (by which we greatly exerciſed our memory) <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  </hi> I ſay, many ſtudents were pricked forward by this our recitall, to hearke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more attentiuely vnto the preaching &amp; leſſons, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they did ordinarily before, and tooke great paines to remember them, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, that they profited more by this means in one yeare: eſpecially hearing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies learned men, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had done before in ſixe yeares by their priuate ſtudies. And conſidering <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  </hi> it is a ſhameful thing, &amp; full of reproch, that thoſe that haue ſo long frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the vniuerſities &amp; places of ſtudy, ſhould ſo negligently ſuffer ſuch opportunities to paſſe ouer, which afterward they could by no meanes recouer, &amp; that they would hereafter be more diligent, if it ſhuld pleaſe God to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the meanes to enioy <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi> like bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings: and as for thoſe that haue not as yet bin at thoſe ſchooles, when they ſhuld be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thither, they do aduiſe them diligently to regard this way of profiting, which is thoght moſt conuenient. Before wee come to ſette downe our method, wee giue counſaile, that to follow and obſerue the ſame profitably, it is neceſſarie that wee ſhould bee furniſhed with thoſe parts which are requiſite and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for the ſame: that is, with knowledge
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:9089:98"/> and learning, in great quantitie and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. For otherwiſe we ſhal looſe our labor, and ſhall not attaine vnto it, no more then a man can build without matter: &amp; in truth, he doth fowly deceiue himſelf, that indeuoureth to imitate one that is ſingular, if hee bee not endued with thoſe gifts, by which the other excelleth. Wherefore euerie one muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the counſaile of <hi>Horace. Euerie one muſt looke what his ſhoulders can beare, and what they cannot beare:</hi> that is, what abilitie and force is in vs, and according to the ſame, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of our ſelues the beſt way that poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly wee may. Neuertheleſſe, wee may aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure our ſelues, that whoſoeuer ſhall but in ſome meaſure, exerciſe himſelfe in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,<note place="margin">In prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the word of God, euery one muſt do as he is able.</note> hee may procure ſufficient know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to ſerue his turne, if will he take paine, becauſe that is not inwrapped with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny difficulties nor ſubtilties, neyther doth conſiſt of many hard precepts to obſerue, but it hath many eaſie poyntes, as all they that vſe to reade them, may finde out by experience.<note place="margin">A profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie method of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in ſixe points.</note> Howe profitable it is, wee will ſay nothing: but we will leaue it to the iudgement of others.</p>
               <p>Firſt of al, we muſt wel conſider &amp; meditate vpon <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi> text which we purpoſe to expound, to the end, that by a dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; deep meditation, we may haue a perfect vnderſtanding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:9089:98"/> and by the eye of our iudgement we may perceiue all the doctrine which maye fitly be gathered out of the ſame, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the end.</p>
               <p>For the ſecond point, we muſt draw out the beginning, from the matter of the text it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it muſt be diuided into partes, that is, ſuch notes muſt bee taken out of the text, which doth naturally ariſe out thereof: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time two, ſometime three, or fower, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the matter which we handle.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, we muſt expound in order euery doctrine, the which the Preacher muſt enrich with diuers amplifications, neither too long, nor too ſhort, but as profitably and fitly as he can, with ſimilitudes.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, he muſt vſe examples, ſometime more, ſometime leſſe, as the Preacher ſhall iudge moſt expedient: ſometimes alſo, it ſhall not be from the matter to vſe inductions, the better to mooue the hearers.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, to make the concluſion, it is beſt to make a ſhort abridgement and ſummarie, of that which he hath handled.<note place="margin">It is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to vſe a method of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfie all the hearers</note>
               </p>
               <p>But becauſe as <hi>Gregorie Nazianzine</hi> ſaith, that in a multitude compounded and ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of all ſorts of men of all ages, of diuers hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors and complexions, it is hard to inuent a method of Preaching, which ſhould be ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:9089:99"/> to all, that euery one ſhould be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and content: and beſides he addeth, that as it is hard to tune all the ſtrings of a Lute, or Sitterne, when one is but touched, ſo euery man may thinke, that this methode cannot pleaſe all, as in truth wee haue not ſette it downe to that effect, but to leaue it to euery mans iudgement. Wherefore wee will expounde more at large, all that which we haue briefly ſaid. Firſt of all, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we ſay, that we ought o haue a good vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the text, we might alledge infinit reaſons wherfore <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  </hi> is neceſſarie: but becauſe euery one maye conceiue many which wee cannot recite, therfore we leaue them to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mans conſideration: ſaying onely in one word, that if any one ſhall be ſo vnwiſe and raſh, to take vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him to expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d a text which he doth not well vnderſtand, he muſt needes fall into an infinit company of abſurdities, and inconueniences.</p>
               <p>Secondly, where as we ſay, that the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning muſt bee drawne from the text it ſelfe, which we well vnderſtand, that muſt be done as well for the eaſe of the preacher, as for him that heareth. Concerning the caſe of the Preacher, it is great in many reſpects, if hee knoweth and can doo it aptly: but if hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conueniently doo it, it ſhall not bee leſſe hard vnto him, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto them which are
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:9089:99"/> accuſtomed to draw it where they can: where ſome begin ſometimes with a place of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as it ſeemeth moſt fit for their matter, others by a rep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tition, ſometimes tedious and vnprofitable, of thoſe things which they haue ſpoken before. Others which reade Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries, begin with that which they finde there: wherby it may come to paſſe, &amp; often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it doth, that many truſting altogither to them, many times they teach thoſe things, which they doo not vnderſtand themſelues: wherof ariſeth many inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueniences, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly theſe two: that is, they are hardly to bee vnderſtood of theyr hearers: and the other is, that in regarde they haue committed thoſe things to memorie, which they vnderſtand not, they doo quicklie forget them againe. There is alſo a third euill: that thoſe that are accuſtomed to learne without booke, not onely the beginning of theyr ſermon, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the moſt part of the reſt, they ſhall verye hardly afterward make them themſelues, and with great difficultie become good peachers. Briefly, the beginning is ſo hard a thing, that it is ſaide in a common Prouerbe, that he that hath well begunne any worke, hath halfe brought it to paſſe. This is ſpoken of any worke whatſoeuer, but by a better reaſon wee may ſaye ſo of our Preaching: For in truth, euery one knoweth by experience, that
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:9089:100"/> thoſe that haue the dexteritie of beginning wel, afterwards without much difficultie, they may proceede: As it is eaſie to builde a houſe when the foundation is well laid. He then that can keepe our method, may auoide all theſe inconueniences. For firſt drawing his beginning from his text, which he well vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth, he ſhall hardly ſpeake any thing, which ſhall not be vnderſtood.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if he hath meditated, or deuiſed any thing, as he muſt continually do, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to vnderſtand that which hee would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, by this meanes I ſay, he ſhal remember all, as naturally we keepe better thoſe things which we deuiſe, then thoſe which we read, or learne of others.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, hee ſhall more plainly bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the hearers, and conſequently, hee ſhall Preache with much more edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, for the eaſe of the preacher, it ſhall be great in two reſpects. Firſt, in that he makes the beginning himſelfe, the which he draweth from the matter, which he doth very well vnderſtand: he cannot be ſo obſcure to his hearers, as if he drew it out of the booke of other men, or rehearſing their ſermons al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togither (as many doo) for although euery one may haue a priuate ſkill of himſelfe, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſome naturall inclination, ſo euery one accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:9089:100"/> to the conceit, may lay the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their ſermons, and by the ſame reaſon, others which will recite other mens workes, not hauing the ſame ſpirite, they cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſe them with ſuch vnderſtanding and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification, as the authors thereof. Secondly, there is no doubt, but that the hearer doth vnderſtand much better, that which the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher vnderſtandeth himſelf when he entreth into his matter. And verily this is a thing which the preacher muſt diligently obſerue, that in the beginning, hee ſpeaketh nothing but firme and ſound things, becauſe that the hearer hearing thoſe things in his enteraunce to his diſcourſe, maye bee the more attentiue to heare the other partes, that followe.<note place="margin">The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſermon, muſt be ſounde matter.</note> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe, if the Preacher beginneth with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of things going before, or elſe doo ſpend more time in thoſe things which are not material, the hearers which haue good eares, hearing that in the beginning, &amp; finding no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing woorthie the marking, they become colde and wearie to heare the reſt of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. It is true, that neceſſitie vrging a man, he may well vſe ſometime a repetition in the beginning of his ſermon, and ſometime in the middeſt: but that which may be done of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie, muſt not be done of cuſtome.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, concerning the diuiſion of the text, gathering thoſe doctrines which are
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:9089:101"/> compriſed therein, wee muſt note, that if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny will deſcribe the beautie of ſome vertue, or the filthineſſe of a vice, or in ſumme, the great profite of ſome leſſons: it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie good to produce many reaſons, and to lette the feebleſt firſt, and then thoſe that are more forcible: and conſequently, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And the reaſon is, in placing the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt firſt, and then the ſtrongeſt, becauſe that the hearer, if he be not moued with one reaſon, two or three of more force beeing added, he may be moued to put that in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, whereunto hee is ſtirred vppe. But herein he muſt take heed of two extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that ſetting downe many reaſons, that they bee not ſtrange from the text,<note place="margin">Two extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities to be auoyded in the expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the text.</note> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it were better for him to content him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with one or two, which may bee fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gathered out of the text, then to alleadge many which are farre feched: the other extremitie is, that beeing deſirous to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe himſelfe altogether within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of his text, that hee will not go out: it commeth to paſſe, that hee dooth rather paraphraſe then expounde. This kinde of interpretation is ſeemely, and conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, for him that teacheth in the ſchoole, for the benefitte of them that doo ſtudie the grounds of diuinitie, who afterwarde beeing well grounded, may interpret th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:9089:101"/> ſcripture in a more ample and popular manner: it ſhall ſuffice vnto them to ſhewe the true ſenſe of the arguments of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the force and vertue of the words which doo occurre in the languages, the which that ſcripture contayneth, but the preacher muſt auoyde this extremitie for two reaſons. The firſt is, that hauing a large text, wee cannot expounde the depth of the ſenſe thereof, nor enter into the bowelles of the ſame, and by that meanes depriue our ſelues of many notable and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent doctrines and comforts, which are buried therein. The other is, that it may make the preacher idle, for onely to runne ouer a large text, which hee hath read, hee ſhall not neede to labour in drawing out all the doctrines and inſtructions, which hee might eaſily gather, becauſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee ſhall haue ſhewed the meaning of his text, the greateſt parte of the time will bee ſpent, and more then is limited for an ordinarie Sermon.</p>
               <p>The greatneſſe or the ſmalneſſe of the profite of the one or the other, plainely dooth appeare in this, that many hearers which are very wel read in the ſcriptures, and who vnderſtand the ſenſe thereof, can ſay as much as they that thus paraphraſtically run ouer a text, but when the hearers which are
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:9089:102"/> ſomething grounded and conuerſaunt in the Scripture, do heare the preacher ſpeak many profitable things, expounding a place excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, and plentifully, &amp; that they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues cannot attaine vnto this kind of expounding the worde of God,<note place="margin">The prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher muſt expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d his text copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly.</note> this may incredibly moue them, and make them verie diligent in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to heare, and attentiue at Sermons, and in ſum, do bring great ioy and good, both to the Preachers, and hearers. Wherefore let vs conclude, that the Preacher ought moſt to giue himſelfe to this maner of expounding the Scripture copiouſly: for he that will bee too ſuccinct, he ſhall not ſo much edifie. And further, it is much better to alledge many things which are of great vſe, although they may ſeeme to ſome ſomewhat ſtrange fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the text, then to bee too ſcrupulous in tying our ſelues too much to our text, and not to edifie. Neuertheleſſe, we ſay, that if our Method be well obſerued, that one can hardly go out of his text, becauſe that taking his beginning from the midſt of the text, which hee well vnderſtandeth, it muſt needs be, that this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning muſt be as a Paraphraſe, and a ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marie of the whole text: afterward, the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plification is a more plentifull declaration ſet downe in order, of al that which was ſpoken in the beginning in a fewe words.</p>
               <p>This beginning may be compared vnto the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:9089:102"/> roundneſſe of a circle, and the expoſition by his parts: that is, a ſtaying within the circle, &amp; ſo to be incloſed, that he cannot go out: or if one would ſpeak more plainly, the beginning is like <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi> ſelling of a marchants ware by whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſale, and the expoſition by parts, is like the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailing thereof. In the fourth place, hauing ſet downe, that we muſt vſe ſimilitudes, we ſay, that it is neceſſarie for infinite reaſons which would be long to recite: but we mean, that ſeeing that ſimilitudes be of maruailous vſe, prouided alwayes that they be of weight, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="198" facs="tcp:9089:103"/> vs ſee what <hi>Eraſmus</hi> ſayth in a moſt eloquent epiſtle, vnto him whome hee dedicated that little booke which hee intitled <hi>Adages.</hi> There is nothing (ſayth hee) among all the ornaments which are to bee giuen to an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, more excellent then a <hi>Metaphor.</hi> Will you delight? there is nothing that hath ſo great delectation: will you teach? there is nothing which prooueth a thing more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually and playnely: will you perſwade? there is nothing of more force and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie: will you ſtudie to bee copious? thou ſhalt finde no other where more rich and plentifull matter: doo you deſire bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uirie? there is nothing which is more fitte: doo you affect high poynts? this dooth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll whatſoeuer thou wilt: will you exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate any thing? there is nothing that will more abaſe it: dooſt thou deſire to bee vnderſtood, and to giue light to a thing? there is nothing which dooth repreſent any thing better before our eyes. By the ſame, Adages are made acceptable: fables haue theyr grace, and theſe doo commende Apothegmes. By the ſame, ſentences are better ſette foorth, and haue more bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. To bee breefe, for the prayſe of a ſimilitude, there is nothing of more force then the example of <hi>Salomon,</hi> who beeing ſo great a man, that beſides Ieſus Chriſt,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:9089:103"/> there was none like vnto him: hee would not adorne his Oracles, but with the title of Prouerbes. Afterwarde hee addeth a poynt to bee marked: Take away (ſayth he) a Metaphor and a ſimilitude from Orators, all things bee little and of no value. Take away the Prouerbes and Parables from the writings of the Prophets and Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, and thou ſhalt take away the moſt part of the grace of the ſcriptures. To all theſe commodities, wee may ioyne alſo this, which is of great conſequence, that is, when one expoundeth an hard place, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that maketh it ſooner to bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood then a ſimilitude:<note place="margin">A Profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vſe of a ſimilitude.</note> for although of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes many reaſons bee brought, and thoſe which bee of force, neuertheleſſe, experience ſheweth, that by them one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo eaſily conceiue many difficulties: but if one vſeth a familiar ſimilitude, and eaſie to bee vnderſtood, it commeth to paſſe, that hard things are without labour vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood: and all thoſe reaſons which were alleadged before, to make the matter playne, are made cleare and manifeſt by ſimilitudes. Wherefore the preacher muſt ſtudie for the ſame with great trauaile and induſtrie, that he may exerciſe his charge with mote fruit.</p>

<pb n="200" facs="tcp:9089:104"/> to garniſh our ſermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s with examples: we ſay that it is neceſſarie for this reaſon principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: that is, becauſe they haue in themſelues maruailous vertue and force, to mooue the hearer, becauſe they ſhew the truth of many things come to paſſe, of which we haue pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and teſtimonies in the ſcripture, in ſuch ſort, that when wee woulde haue the truth of any doctrine to bee vnderſtood, or to ſtirre vppe the hearer to the imbracing of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vertue,<note place="margin">The vſe of examples.</note> or to flie any vice: wee muſt firſt propound thoſe teſtimonies, which doo commaunde, or that doo exhort, or do forbid the one or the other, then wee muſt bring an example, which doth ſhewe as it were with the finger, the effect and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the teſtimonies. Wee may note al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that when we may alleadge many, it is good to place thoſe firſt, which are of leſſe force to moue the hearers, then to vrge the ſtronger (as wee haue counſelled to do, in bringing of reaſons one after another) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the incredible weight which this manner of teaching hath towardes all ſorts of men. It is true, that when occaſion is giuen to make cleare ſome portion of Scripture, ſomething hard, that wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not vſe fitte examples, as wee may doo if wee doo deſcribe the filthineſſe of ſome vice, or the dignitie of ſome vertue, or
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:9089:104"/> ſome ſuch like thing, we may then vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that onely they are to bee vſed in the handling of thoſe things which are needefull to bee made plaine by them.

But becauſe it is eaſie to ſpeake and diſcourſe of diuers me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, but it is hard to obſerue them: wee will heere ſette downe two Sermons, of things which ſeemeth verie hard to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, and in the ſayde two Sermons, all the practiſe of the ſayde method may clearely bee perceiued: to the ende they may bee ſette downe as patternes, that they that will go about to follow the ſame, may doo it more eaſily.

For ſeeing that God is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the proceeding, and maintainer of his life, ſo he ought to thinke, that his dutie is not diſcharged, if he doth employ ſome part of his life, or ſome force of the minde, or the body, to praiſe him, but euen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his birth, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til

But now alas: this litle member is moſt daungerous: by that we ſpeake euill of our brethren, backe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite them by enuying their vertue, ſhewing our contempt of thoſe gifts, and graces which they haue receiued, by that we doo diminiſh as much as in vs lieth, their eſtimation, and credit, and make all men know, that we haue our heart full of wickedneſſe, and ſiniſter af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, towardes them: but that which is more, it is no leſſe diſordered towardes God, for to deſpite him, as much as men may: for by this, we diſhonor him, ſpeake euill of him, by this wicked miſcreants do belch out infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit outrages, &amp; execrable blaſphemies againſt his ſacred maieſtie, which they intollerably teare in ſunder: briefly, by this they commit a multitude of innumerable ſinnes. This is the reaſon why S. <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith, <hi>that this litle mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber boaſteth it ſelfe of great things, that it is a fire which kindleth a forreſt, that it is a world of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe.</hi> (By which words hee would ſignifie no other thing, but from the ſlaundering and intemperancie of the tongue, many miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes ariſeth, when the bridle is let looſe.<note place="margin">The diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note>) But for the better vnderſtanding of this, wee muſt obſerue two points: the firſt is, that by nature, we all are ſubiect to this euill, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of the tongue. Secondly, that being
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:9089:107"/> all ſubiect heereunto, we muſt take heede of flattering of our ſelues, but rather with might and maine auoyde the ſame, and the better to flye from it,<note place="margin">The Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plification of the firſt part.</note> to conſider the horrible miſchiefs which commeth from it. Concerning the firſt part, we muſt conſider, that al in generall hath this vice ſo deepely rooted in our bowelles, that it is impoſſible to abſtaine from the ſame altogither, we are ſo depraued in all our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</p>
               <p>This is the reaſon that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſayth, liuely pointing out the nature of man,<note place="margin">Rom. 3</note> and ſhewing how it is corrupt in it ſelfe, <hi>There is none righteous, no not one. There is none that vnderſtandeth: there is none that ſeeketh God. They haue all gone out of the way, they haue beene made altogither vnprofitable: there is none that doth good, no not one. Their throat is an open ſepulchre, they haue vſed their tongues to deceit: the poyſon of Aſpes is vnder their lippes: whoſe mouth is full of curſing and bitterneſſe, &amp;c.</hi> By which place he ſheweth, that all vniuerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, are euill ſpeakers, and ſlanderers, fowlie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſing our tongue: and although he ſpeaketh principally of <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi> corruption of our nature, after the ſinne of our firſt parents, hee might alſo very eaſily ſpeake of the reſt of our corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which remaineth after our regeneration, and ſo much the rather, becauſe the greateſt
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:9089:107"/> ſeruants of GOD, doo ordinarily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of this euill, to which they are ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted, that they cannot refraine themſelues without a great combat, and violence offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to their nature.</p>
               <p>And for this cauſe, <hi>Dauid</hi> which by the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of the ſcripture, was a man after Gods heart, ſtriuing againſt this vice: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though hee were one of the moſt patienteſt that euer were, in bearing iniuries done vnto him, yet he praieth earneſtly vnto God in this manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Set a watch, O Lorde before my mouth,</hi>

                  <hi>and keepe the doore of my lippes</hi> Vnto which very well agreeth that which Saint <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith: <hi>In many things we ſinne all:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iam. 3</note> 
                  <hi>If any man ſinne not in word, he is a perfect man, and able to bridle all the body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>According to this, mention is made in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine place of a memorable hyſtory of a great Perſonage, who hauing oftentimes imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that there is nothing ſo harde as to bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle the tongue, hee ſaith, that hee hath long co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered &amp; meditated vppon the thirtie and ninth. <hi>Pſal.</hi> of <hi>Dauid,</hi> where it is ſaid, I <hi>thought I will take brede to my waies, that I ſinne not with my tongue:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 39</note> I <hi>will keepe my mouth bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led while the wicked is in my ſight.</hi> But ſayth hee, when hee was dying, I haue liued thirtie ſeaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> yeares, &amp; yet I haue not vnderſtood the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:9089:108"/> meaning of that place, although I haue tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed to finde out the ſame. What then woulde he ſignifie heereby, but that it was a matter of great difficultie to bridle this little member, but that it will breake out beyond her boundes, in defaming them which doo diſpleaſe vs any manner of way. And indeed, we muſt not thinke that <hi>Dauid</hi> practiſed that which he ſaith in this place, but he would giue vs to vnderſtand, that he labored to containe himſelf as much as he could, that although he liued amongſt the outrages of the wicked, yet neuertheleſſe, hee endured them patiently, knowing well, that thoſe things came not to paſſe at aduenture, but by the prouidence of God, who would after this manner exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe him, and in truth, he that will take theſe words ſo ſtricktly, he ſhall marueilouſly bee deceiued: I meane, that woulde thinke neuer any angry, or furious word eſcaped <hi>Dauid</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the wicked: ſo that hee that can finde a man that doth not offend in his tongue, hee ſhall bee the moſt perfect among the liuing. Some haue very well ſaid: that God foreſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the furie, and intameable violence of the tongue, hath barred and incloſed the ſame with a very ſtrong double wall: that is, with the teeth firſt, and then with the lippes, which ſhould be as it were two bulwarks, and ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieres: yet neuertheleſſe it cannot bee kept

<pb n="226" facs="tcp:9089:109"/> docible and patient ſpirit. Let vs note in the firſt place, that the Euangeliſts, &amp; Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> ſaying here, <hi>That Ieſus Chriſt hauing taken the bread, that he eate it with his Diſciples, that he brake it, and gaue it to his Diſciples, ſaying, Take eate, &amp;c.</hi> that in theſe words, there is the inſtitution of the ſupper, the which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

This inſtitution dooth containe three principall poynts, the firſt is, the ſignes, and the ceremonies: the ſecond, their ſignification: the third, the agreement that they haue the one with the other. As co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  </hi> bread, and the wine, which doo repreſent the bodie and bloud of Ieſus Chriſt, becauſe they haue the ſelfeſame vertue to nouriſh our ſoules, as the common bread and wine which wee doo ordinarily vſe for our neceſſitie, hath a proper power to nouriſh our bodyes. For this cauſe Ieſus Chriſt calleth himſelfe in many places, <hi>The bread of life:</hi> not to ſpeake properly, that that bread which is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed into the Supper, is the bread of life of it ſelfe, for it differeth nothing, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the wine alſo, from that which wee doo ordinarily vſe: but this bread and this wine doo nouriſh our ſoules, becauſe they are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained of God to this effect.

                  <pb n="231" facs="tcp:9089:111"/> thing properly, therefore a proper ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication muſt needes bee founde out. So in like manner when it is heere ſayde, <hi>This is my bodie, this is my bloud,</hi> theſe wordes cannot any way beare this ſignification, that wee ſhould vnderſtande by them a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all conuerſion into the bodie and bloud of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, theſe wordes of tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, doo bring with them three abſurdityes. The firſt is, that if the bread and wine ſhoulde bee turned into the body and bloud of Ieſus Chriſt, there ſhould bee no ſigne in the Supper, and ſo there ſhould bee no ſacrament, which cannot bee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a viſible ſigne. The ſeconde is, that the bloud of Ieſus Chriſt ſhoulde bee ſeparated from his bodie, which is alſo abſurde and impoſſible. The thirde, that Ieſus Chriſt ſhoulde haue a bodie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, and by conſequent, hee ſhoulde not bee true man, nor truely aſcended into heauen, which ſhoulde ouerthrowe the principall Articles of our fayth. And tis to no purpoſe to obiect heere, that hee hath a gloryfied body, by which hee may bee at one time in diuers places toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for this replie is vayne, becauſe hee hadde no ſuch bodie, when as hee inſtituted the Supper: and beſides, his
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:9089:112"/> glorification, did not any way diminiſh the nature of a true bodie, but onely did make him infinite, as an auncient Doctor hath verie well ſayde. And wherefore it is ſayde in the Acts of the Apoſtles, <hi>That the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens ſhould containe him vntill the daie of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when hee ſhall viſiblie deſcende, as he was ſeene to aſcende.</hi> The fourth is, that infidels and hypocrites comming to the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, ſhoulde truely participate the bodie and bloud of Chriſt, and ſo it muſt needes follow, that GOD and the diuell ſhould bee lodged togither. And beſides theſe abſurdities, which doo beate downe tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, experience it ſelfe is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. Wee may perceiue the bread and wine to conſume away, beeing long time kept, for this dooth ſhewe moſt plainely, that the ſubſtance of them is not chaunged. As alſo theſe wordes beeing well vnderſtood, doo ouerthrowe tranſubſtantiation, ſo they doo likewiſe confute theyr Couſin germane, which is Conſubſtantiation: that is, thoſe which doo affirme, that the body of Ieſus Chriſt beeing euerie where, it muſt needes bee in the Breade of the Lordes Supper, that it is eyther aboue or belowe, or at one ſide, or within, as his bloud is in the VVine. The wordes of Ieſus
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:9089:112"/> Chriſt, cannot likewiſe beare this ſence. For if they will ſo vnderſtand them, Ieſus Chriſt muſt haue ſaid, <hi>My bodie ſhall bee with this bread, and my bloud with this wine.</hi> Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, this ſhoulde bee to fall to a fleſhlye and carnall eating, which cauſe vs to fall into the three laſt abſurdities of tranſubſtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>When Ieſus Chriſt ſaith to the Caper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naites, who did imagine a carnall eating (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee had ſaid, <hi>That vnleſſe one eate his Fleſh, and drinke his bloud, that he cannot haue eternall life.</hi>) He ſaide vnto them in the Verſe, three ſcore and three, expounding himſelfe: <hi>It is the ſpirit that quickneth, the fleſh profiteth nothing: the wordes that I ſpeake vn-you, are ſpirit and life.</hi> Is not this place cleare inough? to ſhew, that heſe woordes muſt be vnderſtoode, ſpiritually and not carnallye? And although that there hee ſpeaketh not of a ſacramentall eating, but of that which is made by the woorde of GOD, which is receiued by faith, notwithſtanding it maye verye well imparte thus much, becauſe it is the ſame kinde of eating in ſubſtaunce, ſo that whatſoeuer is ſpoken of the one, doth belong alſo to the other: and ſeeing that queſtion is made of the nouriſhment of the ſoule which is ſpirituall, and that the foode thereof is
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:9089:113"/> ſpirituall, it muſt neceſſarily follow, that the eating muſt be alſo ſpirituall, and not groſſe, and carnall. And to be ſo, it cannot other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be, but that the bread and wine ſhoulde be nothing elſe but ſignes onely of the body, and bloud of Chriſt: and that they do alwaies remaine bread and wine, after the wordes of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecration, and after the partaking thereof. As it is eaſie by Saint <hi>Paule,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.</note> where hee ſaith: <hi>The cuppe of bleſſing which we bleſſe, is it not the communion of the bloud of Chriſt? The bread which we breake, is it not the communion of the body of Chriſt?</hi> It is not ſaid, that the cup of bleſſing which one bleſſeth, is the bloud of Chriſt really, &amp; <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  </hi> the bread which we break, is the proper and ſubſtantiall body of Chriſt: but that it is the communion of the one, and of the other, by the which words he declareth plainly, that the bread and the wine doth alwaies remaine bread and wine, but they are certaine and infallible pledges, of that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, which we haue in <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi> body of Chriſt. See alſo, <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  </hi> the bread, &amp; the wine, are nothing but ſignes of the body, and of the bloud of Chriſt: yet neuertheleſſe we do participate of the ſame, as trulie, as if we ſhuld eat his fleſh, and drinke his bloud, after a carnall manner. Let vs adde, that this interpretation (which is the ſecond point we haue to handle) cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth no inconuenience, and that by the ſame,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:9089:113"/> thoſe foure abſurdities which are recited be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, are auoided: for by the ſame, the ſignes remaine in their owne nature, the bloode of Ieſus Chriſt, is not ſeparated from his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, his humainitie is not diminiſhed, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the truth of his aſcenſion, and ſitting at the right hand of his Father.</p>
               <p>And further,<note place="margin">The Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifying of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part.</note> wicked men ſhall not partake of the body of Chriſt, and of his blood. But what will bee obiected, if this bee the true meaning of Chriſt? how is it declared by more manifeſt words, and leſſe doubtfull? One anſwereth, that this promiſe cannot be made by a more briefe kinde of ſpeeche, and more ſignificant. For if hee had ſaide, <hi>This is the pledge, and the ſigne of my body,</hi> there ſhuld not haue been a promiſe as there is, vnleſſe he had vſed more words, as if hee ſhoulde haue ſaide: I aſſure you, that this bread, and this Wine, doth ſo repreſent vnto you my body, and my bloud, that as often as you do partake of theſe viſible things, you ſhall trulie communicate of that which is ſignified vnto you. And ſo it muſt needes haue come to paſſe, that Chriſt muſt haue doone, as flatterers that goe about to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade any man, vſe many woordes, and arguments, but there is no force manye times in theyr ſpeeche, as commonly it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth to thoſe that being deſirous to make
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:9089:114"/> others, beleeue ſomething, they haue copie of words, but little matter. Contrariwiſe, ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and graue things, doo require ordinarily fewe words, but very ſignificant, and full of force, and maieſtie: we ſee for the moſt part, that Kings and Princes ſpeaking of any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of importaunce to them that are about them, oftentimes they vſe but one woorde, which they do print in their minde, as though it were ſome oracle from heauen, they doo ponder, and imagine to finde out that which he would ſay, that if they vſed many wordes, they would not ſo eaſily be carried away, and they which hearde them, would not be ſo at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiue to conſider them. Namely, this is perceiued in great men, when as they make promiſes to their familiars, for beeing ſo made in fewe wordes, they haue more grace and waight. So Ieſus Chriſt in this place ſpeaking to his Diſciples, to communicate with them his body, and his bloud, (which was a thing of great importance) he ſpake in fewe words. <hi>This is my body and my bloud,</hi> that is to ſay, which ſignifieth my body, and my bloud. And this was alſo for the benifit of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples: for they hauing vnderſtoode theſe words of their Maiſter, they might thinke themſelues what their maiſter meant, when he ſaid: <hi>This is my body.</hi> For when he ſpake theſe words vnto them, they were a long time
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:9089:114"/> at the table, eating and drinking with him, &amp; he neuer ſpake any ſuch thing: ſo that they might co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude with themſelues, that by theſe words, he would ſignifie ſome great matter: ſo that this thing beeing well conſidered, his Diſciples might bee the more wakened by theſe fewe wordes full of waight and maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, diligently to ponder them, as if hee had vſed many wordes. Although already this matter is ſufficiently manifeſted, yet wee will make it more euident by theſe reaſons fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. Firſt that ſpirit of God, hath vſed the like ſpeeche as he hath done heere in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of all the ſacraments, of the old teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that is, in giuing the name of the thing ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and inuiſible, vnto the exteriour ſigne. As we reade in <hi>Geneſis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 17</note> that God beeing wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to aſſure <hi>Abraham</hi> &amp; his poſteritie, that Circumciſion was a certaine ſigne vnto them, that he had receiued them into his couenant, hee calleth Circumciſion his couenant,<note place="margin">Exod. 12.</note> in fewe words. The like ſaith <hi>Moſes</hi> of the Sacrament of the Paſchall Lambe, calling it the Lords paſſeouer: for to ſignifie vnto the Iewes, that they ſhould be aſſured of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall fauour of God, hauing giuen them a taſte of his incomprehenſible bountie, when he ſent his deſtroying Angell, who ſlewe all the firſt borne, as well of men as of beaſtes, in all the houſes of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and paſſed ouer the
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:9089:115"/> children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> without dooing them any hurt, whereof that ceremony of the Paſchall Lambe, was to them a ſacrament. To theſe kindes of ſpeaking, we may ioyne that which S. <hi>Paul</hi> vſeth,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 10</note> where he ſaith: <hi>That our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers haue eat the ſame meat, and drunk the ſame drinke in the wilderneſſe, which we haue done, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that the rocke out of which iſſued the water which they dranke, was Chriſt:</hi> for this manner of ſpeeche is altogither like this. But lette vs diligently obſerue, that this maner of ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,) <hi>This is my body,</hi> wherof here queſtion is made: is likewiſe ſo vſed in our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tongue, as for example, If a king ſheweth fauour vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a male factor, giuing vnto him, the letters of his fauour, ſealed with his owne ſeale, it is ſaid co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly to the malefactor, beholde thy pardon: &amp; yet neuertheleſſe, thoſe letters which are giuen him, are not his pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but a certain &amp; infallible ſigne of his pardon. So in this ſacrament we ſee the like, for they are called ſeales of the word of God. As Saint <hi>Paule</hi> doth beare witneſſe of Circumciſion:<note place="margin">Rom. 4</note> which he calleth to the Romaines, <hi>The ſeale of the righteouſneſſe of faith.</hi> It ſeemeth, that it was impoſſible to vſe any plainer kinde of ſpeech to vnderſtand, Chriſts meaning, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any conceit of carnal eating, and humain drinking, as though we were deuourers of men like thoſe kinde of people, called <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropophagi,</hi>
                  <pb n="239" facs="tcp:9089:115"/> and <hi>Cyclopes.</hi> But we may cauſe a greater light to ſhine to our ſelues, when we are certainly aſſured, that we do partake the body and bloud of Chriſt, by ſaith: which is the proper inſtrument which God hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, to eat his body, and drinke his bloud, that is, that we conſtantly beleeue, that we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate trulie with his body, and that our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences are thereof ſo well aſſured,<note place="margin">The meane how we doe partake the body, and blood of Chriſt in, the ſupper.</note> that wee neede not to doubt. Therfore one of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers hath ſaid, that when we come to this ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that we muſt not prepare our teeth nor our mouth, but <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  </hi> we muſt beleeue, &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we haue eate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ieſus Chrſt, &amp; for this cauſe faith (as ſome of <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi> auncient doctors affirm) is <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi> eie, by which we ſee Chriſt: <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

                  </hi> we do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate with <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi> body of Chriſt, &amp; with his bloud, yea we may ſay, we are more certain thereof, becauſe our outward ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces are ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times deceiued, the eie thinketh to ſee a thing <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi> which it ſeeth not: or it is ſome other thing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But faith beeing true and ſincere, cannot bee ſo deceiued. So that a Chriſtian may conclude, that he is more aſſured by the inſtrument of faith, to pertici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi> body &amp; bloud of Ieſus Chriſt in the ſacrament, then by the ſight of his eyes, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his eares, touching of his handes, or taſting with his mouth. And finally if wee ſhould ſet down that which is commonly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected in this place, that is, howe this can bee done, and that Ieſus Chriſt is aloft in heauen, and we belowe vpon the earth, yet neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, that he ſhould giue vnto vs his body, and his bloud. To this we anſwere, <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  </hi> God can do it by his word, which is incomprehenſible: but to the ende it ſhall not ſeeme ſo ſtraunge to our carnall vnderſtanding,<note place="margin">Notable ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes, ſhewing clearely how we doo partake the body of Chriſt.</note> we would vſe a familiar ſimilitude, to make the ſame more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident. The firſt ſhall be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the ſunne, the which as it doth communicate by his beames, and reuerborations, his force and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacie, vnto them that liue heere belowe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be a dead creature, as the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers affirme: by a farre greater reaſon Ieſus Chriſt the Creator, the ſonne of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, beeing on high in Heauen, at the right
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:9089:116"/> hand of his father, he can more eaſily commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate his bodie and his bloud in the Supper, by an infinite vertue, and an incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible power of his ſpirite, becauſe vnto him, it is no matter of any difficultie, to ioyne things togither that are farre diſtant, as thoſe that are neare.</p>
               <p>The other ſimilitude although it be weake, yet it may ſerue to vnderſtand this myſterie, (for it is a hard thing to finde out thoſe things which are ſtrong inough, to ſignifie in any ſort this incomprehenſible ſecret) it ſhall bee taken from a great and high Tree, which from the center of the earth, reacheth as it were vnto the heauens (as mention is made of ſuch a tree, which <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezar</hi> ſaw in his dreame) ſeeing that the life and the vertue which dooth main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine all the branches and leaues in this tree, be in the roote, which although it be hidden in the earth, yet it dooth eaſily nouriſh, and giueth a growing life vnto the higheſt boughes, although they bee farre from the roote, wherein is the ſpring, and fountaine of life. if I ſay, this creature without life, can doo this eaſily, why ſhould wee not beleeue that Ieſus Chriſt the Creator and conſeruer of all things, can communicate vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs his ſubſtance, to nouriſh our ſelues, without comming downe from heauen,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:9089:117"/> by his ſpirit, ſeeing that hee hath promiſed the ſame: and hee maketh vs to feele it by experience, when it pleaſeth him? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee may infallibly conclude, that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt nouriſheth and quickneth our ſoules, and watereth them by his bloud, in this holy ſacrament, ſo certainely, that wee neede not any thing to doubt, if ſo bee that we haue fayth, which beeing formed in vs by the ſpirit of God, doth engender in vs ſo much the more great perſwaſions, as it is great and plentifull in vs: ſo that if wee ſuffer our ſelues alwayes to bee led by this ſpirite, wee ſhall feele more and more his preſence in this holy Sacrament: prouided alſo, that wee doo disburden our ſelues of all carnall opinions. Eor if wee be repleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with them, and ſuffer our ſelues to bee gouerned by them, it is to be feared, leaſt that wee looſe his preſence altogether, and as wee may ſay, with extreame greefe and ſorrow, that many ſeeking the ſame, with theyr owne carnall phantaſie, haue miſerably loſt the ſame, and haue found the preſence of the diuell.

So that the beſt way for euerie one, is to bee acquainted with his owne voyce, and ſo to order his ſpeech: but vnto whome GOD hath giuen a fitte and agreeable voyce, hee muſt take great heede in gouerning the ſame: for ſeeing that ſuch a voyce is one of the greateſt giftes of GOD that a Preacher can haue, hee muſt beware that hee dooth apply the ſame to the beſt vſe: but howe ſhall hee vſe it? princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally in preaching, hee ſhall keepe alwayes the ſame tenour ſufficiently high, that all may vnderſtande euerie worde that hee doth vtter:<note place="margin">A good voyce in a preacher, is a ſingular gift of God.</note> when hee alſo ſhall ſpeake diſtinctly and leyſerly, for to ſpeake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loude and faſt, the hearer cannot vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and by conſequent, not conceiue that which the Preacher ſayth.<note place="margin">Sen. in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt.</note> 
                  <hi>Seneca</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of that manner which <hi>Cicero</hi> vſed in the pronouncing of his Orations, that hee ſpake for the moſt parte diſtinctly and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, that is, it came from him with great eaſe, not haſtly, that in him there was a kinde of eaſineſſe, no celeritie: afterwarde hee addeth: I deſire then in an Orator, that his wordes may paſſe from him without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny lette, and that hee pronounceth his
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:9089:120"/> words, as though they ſhould flow from him. And this is that which a preacher ſhould labour for in the pronouncing of Sermons vnto the people, becauſe of the great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit that commeth thereof.</p>
               <p>Lette vs ioyne vnto this another ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſame Authour, that the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of learning and eloquence, doo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in the fitte pronuntiation and geſture of the bodie, with which hee that is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, hee may aſſaile the hearers three manner of wayes.<note place="margin">The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the voyce when it is orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as it ought to be</note> Firſt in pearcing into theyr eares. Secondly, in delighting them. Thirdly, in gayning theyr hearts. And heere wee may obſerue two poyntes verie profitable for the preacher. The firſt is concerning pronuntiation, the which as experience teacheth, hath great force in teaching, eſpecially when it is well ordered. For although a man bee profounde in knowledge, yet if hee hath no grace in pronouncing, hee can little edifie, but if hee bee garniſhed with a milde ſpirite, and with a grace of pronuntiation, hee doth maruailouſly edifie, although hee handle not deepe and profounde mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <p>But well to order, and to diſpoſe this voyce, what muſt hee doo? hee muſt oftentimes chaunge the ſame, according
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:9089:121"/> to the occaſions which may bee offered, that is, in ſpeaking ſometime high and ſometime lowe but in ſuch ſort, that he may be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of all, if it be poſſible. Moreouer, hee muſt conſider, when he ſpeaketh of ſweet &amp; delightfull things (as of the promiſes of god) that he do likewiſe in ſome ſort expreſſe the ſweetneſſe of them, by his voice: and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſpeaketh of fearefull things, which are to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſh the hearers, as with the iudgements of god, and threatnings againſt men, it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie to force the voice, and to make the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer as it were,<note place="margin">When a preacher doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the iudgements of God, hee muſt ſpeak harſhly. When he ſpeaketh of the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God, pleaſantly.</note> to tremble at the denuntiation of them. For in truth, as <hi>Cicero</hi> hath very well ſaid, it is a fault in an Orator, when hee ſheweth a thing full of pleaſure and delight, with ſorrowfull words, as when hee pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth a baſe thing, with a pleaſant and delicate ſtile. The other point is, when he ſpeaketh of any thing done, he muſt vſe ſo much pronu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, as is requiſite, becauſe it is of no ſmall force, when it is done with modeſtie: but if it be done with affectatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to pleaſe the hearers &amp; if it hath immodeſty mingled with it, as the ſhaking of the whole bodie, the moouing of the hands, of the feete, and of the armes, and with the turning of the heade altogither af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected (although hee may edifie the ruder ſort, becauſe that oftentimes they are more rauiſhed with ſuch motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the voice
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:9089:121"/> and inſtruction) hee muſt auoyd it as much as he can.</p>
               <p>The reaſon is, becauſe that preachers, which do declare good &amp; profitable things (which do require humilitie) they ought to ſhewe in all things, a ſingular modeſtie. That were more tollerable in courts, wherin matters are pleaded, for lawyers, &amp; rhethoritians, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators, which handle matters, which may bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter agree with ſuch kinde of ſpeaking, then with the ſacred diuinitie. It is true alſo, that he muſt not be ſcrupulous, as ſome, which would not haue vs to vſe any geſture at all, nor to delight the hearer in any thing.<note place="margin">As an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>meth the Preacher, ſo an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modeſtie vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſeemely, &amp; he muſt ab<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtaine from it.</note> For if the hearer bee delighted with the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher (vſing an honeſt geſture) &amp; taketh a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular pleaſure in hearing him, <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  </hi> may alſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much edifie, if he heareth with deſire: and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this delight, there may proceed alſo ſome frute, that he may receiue, which taketh ſuch pleaſure in hearing: ſo that for this cauſe, wee may apply our ſelues ſomewhat to delight the audience. But hee muſt take heede of one fault, into which hee maye fall, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in regard of his voice, that is,<note place="margin">How the voyce may be abuſed.</note> in making it to reſound, and to giue an Eccho, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is heard but the ſound, and litle inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is gathered of all that is pronounced by ſuch a pleaſant and delightfull voice. For it is a thing not onely vndecent, but alſo very
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:9089:122"/> vitious, to pronounce a light and vaine thing with a graue voice, as though it were a matter worthy great commendation, as to ſpeake of graue and ſerious matters with a reſounding, and delectable voice.

Such be like ſome amongſt the Philoſophers, who doo not onely boaſt to knowe any thing, but that they can anſwer readily to euery demaund, without needing any preparation, or meditation: but as the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour of theſe men, hath iuſtly bin thought rediculous of many of the ſounder Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, the cuſtome of Preachers which goe about to make the like vaunt of their vanitie, is more worthy to be laughed at, and blamed, becauſe it is almoſt a thing impoſſible to ſpeake well of an high and ſerious matter a long time,<note place="margin">The prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher muſt neuer preach without ſtudy. 1 Orat.</note> and to edification, without thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vpon the ſame before hand. <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith, that it is profitable ſometime to ſpeak on the ſuddain, but it is more profitable when one is prepared thereunto, becauſe there cannot be much ioyce in that which is without preme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation.</p>

                  </hi> naturally knowledge puffeth vp, &amp; maketh the moſt part of men proud, it is great maruell, if thoſe which haue gotten knowledge, &amp; which are deſirous to obtain it, become not inſole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, if they liue pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uately, without co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municating their gifts with other men: wherof it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth, that ſuch hauing

                  </hi> cauſe, that ſuch oftentimes by incou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tring of others in conference, being reprehended and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered to be ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, they are very much grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued &amp; caſt down, &amp; this is becauſe principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they perceiue <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi> report of their ſufficiencie to be diminiſhed, and therby to be diſhono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Inſomuch, that ſome when they come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to companie, do bluſh for ſhame: other do purſue with deadlye hatred, thoſe which haue reproued them, other break out into in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate paſſions, &amp; do defend by al means that errour, whereof they were reproued, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be very foule &amp; monſtrous, imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by that ſtifneſſe in opinion, in ſome ſort to recouer that honour, which they thinke to be made leſſe: wherby ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times they fal into great &amp; horrible miſchiefs. To be brief, ſuch accidents do caſt them headlong into ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge troubles, and perturbations of the ſoule, as we may ſee by experience, &amp; many can be good and ſufficient witneſſes hereof. But when one is accuſtomed to be reproued, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue, or to be ouercome, or to ouercome, it is profitable both for him that is ouercome, &amp; reproued: as for him that doth ouercome, or reproue. It is profitable for him <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  </hi> is ouercom, or reproued, in this, that when he is reproued in ſom reaſoning, as may fal out, it is not grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:9089:125"/> to him at al, becauſe he is accuſtomed to it: but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie, it is pleaſant, &amp; profitable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by this means he learneth, according to the ſaying of one of <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi> fathers, that when one is reproued, he is inſtructed. It is profitable alſo for him <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  </hi> doth reproue &amp; ouercome, in this that being accuſtomed to ouercome, and to be ouercome, he doth not therfore deſpiſe him which is ouercome, or reproued, althogh he be farre more ſufficient then him: becauſe that in ſuch a caſe, if he ſhould deſpiſe him, it might ſo come to paſſe, that being reproued, or ouercome, he ſhould fal into the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, vnto which he wold bring him, whom he hath reproued, or ouercome. And by this means the vanitie of them may be corrected, who hauing reproued or taught any one in ſome childiſh thing, &amp; of ſome ſmall impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, do afterward make their boaſts &amp; brags of it, to their own praiſe, &amp; to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tempt of them, whom they haue reproued or taught: in which they do many times rather ſhewe their ſottiſhnes, and ignorance, then their learning and wiſdome. To what end then ſuch confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences ſerueth, euery one may diſcerne by theſe reaſons ſet downe: &amp; aboue all things (the ſame being as that oyntment called <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guentum catholicum,</hi> to purge vs of that folly, and imaginarie fantaſie, which wee conceiue ordinarily of our owne ſufficiencie,) we may
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:9089:126"/> conclude, that the exerciſe of them is ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,<note place="margin">The prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher muſt be skilfull in diſputing</note> as the want of them is hurtfull. But ſeeing that wee handle here principally the maner of diſputing, which is altogether neceſſary for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which deſire the office of a preacher, to conuince the gainſayers of the truth: we ſay generally, <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  </hi> a preacher muſt not leſſe apply his ſtudy, diligently to attain vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the art of diſputing, to be able to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uince, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the faculty of preaching with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. And the rather at this day, becauſe we liue in ſuch an age, in which the truth is ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured and inwrapped, in ſuch craftie ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that the ſimple and ignorant men, are made to beleeue, that light is darkeneſſe, and truth falſhood: ſo <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  </hi> it is aboue al things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, that the preacher be endued with the knowledge of diſputing, to defend the truth againſt the ſubtile practiſes of <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi> aduerſaries of the ſame. But here he muſt take heed of an extremity, that in ſteed of being a good diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puter,<note place="margin">Sophiſtrie burteth much.</note> he becomes not a Sophiſter. This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie is dangerous for two reaſons: the firſt is, that he <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi> learneth it, trauaileth greatly to attain it, &amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hath gotten <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi> ſame, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth him nothing at all, but greatly hurteth him. For we ſee by experience, that they that are as it were drunke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the ſame, thinking themſelues vnequall to others, they become for the moſt part very proude &amp; inſolent, ful
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:9089:126"/> of vaine glorie, which be great hinderances to attaine vnto any ſoundneſſe in learning. There bee ſome that compare verie fitlie the Sophiſter vnto a certaine beaſt called <hi>Bonaſus,</hi> who carrieth hornes which ſerue him ro no vſe, but are burdenſome, becauſe they are inwrapped the one within the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: in like maner, Sophiſters haue logick ſo intricate, that it cannot ſerue their turnes, but rather do them much harme. The ſecond reaſon is, that it is alſo hurtfull, as well to others, as to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues. For they vnto whom they ſpeak, for the moſt parte cannot vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what they ſay, and that which is worſe, they do often ſeduce &amp; deceiue many, who cannot conceiue or iudge of theyr ſubtilties. And wee muſt not bee miſtaken, as though we blamed logicke, as men ignorant of the ſame: for we know by experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  </hi> it is ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie for a Preacher, that without it, he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not not onelie conuince the gainſayers, but alſo he cannot handle the word of God with good order &amp; diſpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:<note place="margin">A fit ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the vſe of logicke, when it is ſoberly ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died, and the abuſe in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe.</note> but we do find fault with the exceſſe, into which many enter after this ſtudy, becauſe <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  </hi> the exceſſe doth much and more harme, then a meane knowledge therof doth good. For euen as the Iuy leaues whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are applyed outwardly to <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi> ſinows, do very much eaſe the pain, but if one drink the iuice of the hearb, it hurteth them: as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:9089:127"/> natural philoſophers haue ſaid: euen ſo if one be exceſſiue in the ſtudy of logick, it ſhal greatly hinder his other ſtudies, &amp; eſpecially his godlines: but if he ſhal lightly touch it as it were without, he ſhall further his learning. It is truely ſaid,<note place="margin">Cannon of Pope Vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban.</note> that ſeeing that Sophiſtrie is deuiſed, as a certaine Cannon ſaieth, not to build, but to deſtroy, not to make <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi> truth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, but to obſcure it, and that the preacher muſt defend it againſt all the obſtacles ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, it is good that he vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth Sophiſtry, not to vſe it to deceiue others, but to defende himſelfe, and that they vſe it as phiſitions doo venimous hearbs: that is, as it is profitable for them to know them, that they carefully take heed of them, and that they may vſe them (if occaſion ſerueth) in ſome cauſe of neceſſitie, The Paſtor alſo muſt not bee ignoraunt of Sophiſtrie, to the ende hee may maintaine the ſounde doctrine againſt all Sophiſters. But if hee that deſireth to bee a preacher, wil excell in this Arte, not contenting himſelfe with a meane knowledge therein, hee may ſpend much of his time vnprofitably, &amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hath wel ſweat at it, he ſhall find no great vſe thereof. For it is not the right way to come to a ſound knowledge, but a wrong and crooked way, in which all they that haue walked, they haue ſtrangely erred, as we may ſee at this day many, who affecting ſounde
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:9089:127"/> knowledge, haue ſtayed too long in this, and that for want of iudgement, which is the cauſe they trauaile much, and yet ſtil remain barren. This is the complaint of an aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Doctor, ſaying:<note place="margin">Hug. 3. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daſco.</note> Whereof commeth it to paſſe, that ſo great a multitude of learners, of which many haue a good ſpirit, and doo vſe exerciſe, and yet verie fewe are founde which doo attaine vnto true knowledge: we muſt know that in euerie action whatſoeuer it bee, we muſt obſerue two things. The firſt is, to knowe the woorke which one goeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to doo: The ſecond is, to be acquainted with the meanes of compaſſing the ſame: for theſe two thinges muſt bee ſo knitte together, that the one without the other is vnprofitable. After hee addeth, that wiſedom is better then force, for wiſedome doth that by and by, which force is a long time in dooing.<note place="margin">To attaine ſound knowledge, we muſt proceede in our ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies with iudgement.</note> Alſo in euerie ſtudy what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer it bee, hee that laboureth without order and diſcretion, hee trauaileth well, but he bringeth not his ſtudy to that perfection as is conuenient, and he is like vnto him that beateth the aire, or caſteth ſtones againſt the wind. Looke vpon (ſaith he a little after) two men walking in the forreſt, the one going in a crooked way, the other in a plaine, both go to the ſame place by diuers wayes, but both do not a like, but he that goeth the right way
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:9089:128"/> ſooner commeth to his iournies end then the other. This is that which wee ſee at this day in many ſchollers, who being light witted, and hauing no iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, do miſerably looſe the greateſt part of their time in trifles and ſophiſticall quiddities. They think <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  </hi> they can neuer vnderſtand diuinitie, without the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of <hi>Ariſtotles Organum,</hi> and ſo being ſeduced with theſe vaine thoughts, they euer after crucifie themſelues: ſo <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  </hi> they that imagine that they haue very great know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, they do beleeue that they haue found the bean in the cake, &amp; they that haue entred ſomwhat further, perſwade themſelues, <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  </hi> for their learning none is to be compared to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; they make no reckoning of any, although their knowledge bee neuer ſo good, vnleſſe they fit their conceit in this matter. So that they are in ſuch taking, as they be which drinke of the water of the floud <hi>Gallus,</hi> which is in <hi>Phrygia,</hi> which eaſeth all them that haue any diſeaſe in theyr bodyes (for it hath ſuch a vertue, as certaine Philoſophers beare witneſſe, to cure in ſome ſort, all the diſeaſes of the body) when one drinketh moderately therof, but if it be drunke with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out meaſure, it maketh men madde: euen ſo thoſe that are drunke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the ſtudy of phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie, doo looſe often times their vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and become frantick: but they are

               <p>There are at this day many commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taryes vppon <hi>Ariſtotles Organum,</hi> the which, if they were diligently read, they might cauſe one to vnderſtande as much as is expedient to knowe: but amongſt others, there is a tranſlation in French of S. <hi>Freſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,</hi> a Gentleman and Councellor to the French King, a man of rare knowledge, who for his rare and ſurpaſſing dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, hath made that <hi>Organum</hi> ſo eaſie, by thoſe exquiſite ornaments, wherewith he hath enriched the ſame, that he that will ſeriouſly reade it, if hee bee but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſeene in Logick, and hath any iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, hee may gette more knowledge in that arte in foure or fiue monethes, then one may gette in reading, before ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other commentaryes, in three or foure yeares.

                  </gap> hath ſhewed ſo ſhort a way to come to that knowledge, which before wee could not attaine vnto, but in long time, and that not ſo ſurely, as by following his ſteppes.</p>
               <p>Lette vs beſides, heere adde a notable
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:9089:129"/> point, principally for them who cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniently go and ſtay long at the ſchooles, to learne the art of diſputation: that is, that to ouercome the gainſayers, they may do it with naturall Logicke: ſo that it be grounded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the worde of God. And in truth, that is the true forme to diſpute in Diuinitie, to haue ſounde and exact knowledge of the places of the Scripture: for whatſoeuer ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument it be, (how ſubtill ſoeuer,) the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions muſt bee proued by the Text of Scripture,<note place="margin">Naturall logick may conuince the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of the truth.</note> it is certaine, that if one bee ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientlye grounded in the vnderſtanding thereof, the Arguments may eaſily be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne that are propounded vnto vs. For if wee vnderſtande the places, vpon which theyr ſillogiſmes are grounded, they may eaſily bee aunſwered without any difficultie. And let vs marke, that if wee muſt apply our ſelues principally to know well the reaſons of ſome difficultie which may be obiected, and yet that there bee many ignoraunt to make ſyllogiſmes, and yet neuertheleſſe, they may propoſe great difficulties, vnto which vnleſſe you aunſwere by liuely reaſons, they will not bee ſatisfied, and if you will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute with them ſyllogiſtically, they will thinke you impertinent to the matter, as vnleſſe the diſputation bee made in the Schoole by ſyllogiſme, it is counted ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd.
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:9089:129"/> And although many are to bee founde at this day, which themſelues make bookes which are not vnprofitable, it is not greatly to bee diſcommended. And wee may adde that thoſe that are filled with ſounde reaſons,<note place="margin">Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of the truth, muſt be confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by ſound rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and not by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiltie.</note> that they can readily proue or confute any thing, although they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande not the manner of making a ſyllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſme (ſeeing that it is impoſſible for them that ſeldome or neuer frequent the ſchooles) they are to bee preferred before thoſe, which haue no other thing then ſome tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling cauils.</p>
               <p>But becauſe peraduenture wee haue no ſufficient authoritie to perſwade this to ſome, wee will produce the authorities of the auncient, who are more experienced in theſe thinges, then any man at this day can bee. <hi>Peter Rau.</hi> ſayth in a certaine Sermon, that there is nothing more woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to bee hated then ſubtiltie, if there bee nothing elſe but ſubtiltie.

<pb n="268" facs="tcp:9089:130"/> he) is the minde which waxeth proude with ſubtiltie, and hath in it ſelfe no grauitie. The ſame author ſaith likewiſe in another place, what profit is it to ouerthrow the writings of others? to confirme ſophiſticall fallacies by words alone? to condemne the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the ancient, and to miſlike all things that is not founde in the writings of theyr maiſters? The ſame <hi>Seneca,</hi> in his fortie and fiue Epiſtle ſaith, that cauilling, robbeth the time: and he addeth, we tye knottes with our words, by doubtfull ſignifications, and a litle after, we do vntie them againe.

The elder women as mothers, the yonger, as Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, with all pureneſſe, and ſo conſequently with all others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But becauſe there is not much difficulty in this, let vs come to thoſe reprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,<note place="margin">Great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion muſt be v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion.</note> aſwel in houſes, as abroad, which muſt be don with as great courteſie as may be poſſible. For ſeeing that reprehenſion is of it ſelfe rude, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant, it muſt be caried, with great diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>When the Phiſitians goe to viſit their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, they doo conſider, a long time, how they may remooue away the diſeaſe, before they apply any medicine, for if they ſhould vſe any phiſicke not knowing the ſickneſſe, they might make the diſeaſe the greater. So Paſtors muſt vſe this wiſedome. But as the Phiſitions, doo diligently take heede to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a pleaſant Medicine, where a ſharper is neceſſarie, and the Chirurgion doth not make a gentle playſter: where hee muſt vſe a cautery: the preachers in like maner ought both publikely &amp; priuately take heed, <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  </hi> they vſe not alluring ſpeeches, when they ſhould ſpeak ſharply. And becauſe it is an eaſie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the Preacher to fall into this fault, principally then, when they are called to
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:9089:132"/> ſpeake before Kings and Princes, it is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of great difficultie. For great men are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed to heare themſelues cenſured, and commonly they are incenſed in ſuch ſort, that thoſe that reprehend them, are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger. To correct this feare, we muſt do that which the word of god commandeth vs: and herein follow the example of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. The teſtimonies of the worde for this point, are almoſt infinit, where this is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, and euery one may read the ſame: but wee will produce ſome of the auncient fathers,<note place="margin">The prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher muſt not flatter whom he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue.</note> which are known to euery one, which ought to be of great importance to perſwade euery one to ouercome this difficultie. Firſt, when Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſpeaketh in his booke <hi>de Doctri. Chriſti.</hi> That the tongues of flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers do binde men in their ſinnes: this ought much to mooue the Paſtor. For ſeeing that he is ordained by God, to reprehend ſinne, and to deteſt them, that commits them, and if he doth it not, he heapeth vp the wrath of God vpon his owne head. Secondly, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith, in his ſixt Epiſtle: that there is nothing more dangerous for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter in reſpect of God, nor more vile to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men, then not to pronounce freely the truth, which he knoweth and ſeeth: this ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo ought to ſtir vp the Paſtor, to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend euill without flatterie. Thirdly, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:9089:132"/> S. <hi>Gregorie</hi> in a certain Homily ſaith, That we that liue in the oblations of the faithfull, the which they offer for theyr ſinnes, if wee eate theyr oblations, and conceale theyr ſinnes, we eate their ſinnes. Hee ſayth alſo in the ſame place, Conſider my brethren, what a condemnation you procure to your ſelues, when without labour ye take the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of labour: what a hainous crime is this, to take the price of ſinne, and in our preaching, to ſpeake nothing againſt ſinne? Alſo hee ſayth in one of his Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes vppon <hi>Ezechiel:</hi> We that are called Prieſtes, beſides many ſinnes which are proper vnto vs, wee doo adde vnto our ſelues other mens ſinnes, when wee doo not reprooue them: that is to ſay, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as die in theyr ſinnes, wee are the cauſe of theyr deathes, if wee reprehende them not, as our dutie requireth. All theſe ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings ought to enter into vs, and to pearce through the marrow, if wee be negligent and colde in declaring the faults of them which are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted vnto vs by Ieſus Chriſt. This verily is a poynt to be noted, if we take the wages of men, then wee ought to bee diligent and watchfull to reprehende them, when occaſion ſerueth, becauſe that may preuaile very much to amende them.</p>
               <p>The opinion of ſome is, that if they
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:9089:133"/> reprehend freely, that they ſhal not be paid: and the opinion of ſom ignorant men is, who imagine that they ought not to be cenſured in their iniquities, when they giue any thing to the Paſtor.<note place="margin">VVhether it be lawful to repre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>hende princes.</note> But ſome will reply, that this muſt be done towardes Artizans, and ſimple men, by the contentation, or diſcontentment of whom no inconuenience may ariſe: but towardes kings and princes, we muſt take great heed, and deal wiſely, becauſe that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fearefull accidents may come by their diſpleaſure. We anſwer, that the honour of God, which we ought to ſeeke in all thinges, and aboue all, and the ſaluation of ſoules, whereof we haue the diſpenſation, ought to cauſe vs to diſpiſe theſe vaine and friuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous conceits. <hi>VVe muſt not</hi> (ſaith ſaint <hi>Ierom) ſo flatter Princes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lib. 7. vpon Eſay.</note> 
                  <hi>as that the truth of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſhould be diſpiſed.</hi> And in truth, we muſt principally beware in our reprehenſions, that we ought more to eſteeme the truth of God, then feare to offend great men, when we are moued with zeale of their ſaluation. And this alſo is to be done by the example of the Prophets and Apoſtles. The man of God of whome mention is made in the 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.<note place="margin">1.

To do theſe things aptly, euerie one muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that he ought to haue great experience, and to get this experience, it is neceſſarie that he be of ſufficient age. <hi>Gregory Nazianzene</hi> hath very well ſaid, that great aduiſe muſt be taken of what age he is, that goeth about the office of a preacher, for feare leaſt if any come vnto it before their time, they may come ſhort in dooing their dutie when time requireth: as if he would ſay, he hurteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in entring into this function, before hee commeth to mature age.

This is that which <hi>Dauid</hi> the great king and Prophet did, when he was aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by his owne ſonne <hi>Abſolon,</hi> after ſuch a ſubtill and craftie manner, that there was no outwarde appearaunce of eſcape, but hee muſt needes haue beene vtterlie vndone, had not God prouided for him, for fearing greatlie the counſell of <hi>Achitophel,</hi> which was eſteemed at that time as a diuine Oracle, hee praied vnto God after a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment manner, that it would pleaſe him to

So ſhee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from him, &amp; ſhut the doore vpon her, and vpon her ſonnes. And they brought to
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:9089:146"/> her, and ſhee powred out. And when the, veſſelles were full, ſhee ſayde to her ſonne bring mee yet a veſſell, and hee ſayde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her,<note place="margin">1. King: 17</note> there is no more veſſels. Wee may ſee the like example of the widow of <hi>Sarep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> of whome when the prophet <hi>Eliah</hi> had demaunded in the time of a famine, a little water and a morſell of bread, ſhee hauing aunſwered him, that ſhee hadde but a little Oyle in a cruſe, and a little meale in a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, and that ſhe had gathered ſticks to dreſſe the ſame for her and her ſon, and then when they had eaten it, they ſhuld die. What came to paſſe? The prophet told her that ſhe ſhuld not doubt to giue vnto him, becauſe the Lord had ſayde, that her meale and her oyle ſhould not faile, which preſently ſhe founde to be true by experience, for neither the one nor the other was waſted, according to the word of the Lord. <hi>Elizeus</hi> multiplied the loaues of the firſt fruits, which he gaue vnto thoſe which were hungrie,<note place="margin">1.

Further we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, that euen as the prophets do command when it pleaſeth God, the waters which are vpon the earth, and that they do obey them, ſo they may doo the like with the waters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the earth,<note place="margin">1: King: 17</note> as wee may ſee by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Eliah,</hi> who ſayde vnto <hi>Achab,</hi> that in certayne yeares, there ſhoulde bee
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:9089:146"/> neither dew, nor raine, but at his word alone. And afterwatd it is ſaid,<note place="margin">The word of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of god cauſeth the waters aboue and belowe to obey.</note> that <hi>Eliah</hi> bowing his face downe to the ground, and putting it betwixt his knees, hee prayed earneſtly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen times, vnto God, and he ſawe at length, the heauens to wax black, with cloudes, and with winde, and after, there followed a great rayne. This is that which S. <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith: <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah was a man ſubiect to like paſſions, as we are,</hi>

                  <hi>&amp; he prayed earneſtly, that it might not rayne, and it rayned not on the earth, for three yeares, and ſix monethes. And he prayed againe, and the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen gaue rayne, and the earth brought forth her fruite.</hi> We reade alſo an hyſtorie, more nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that <hi>Iehoram</hi> the King of <hi>Iſrael, Iehoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat,</hi> and the King of <hi>Edom,</hi> and theyr army being in diſtreſſe, for lack of water, then whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they went to make warre againſt <hi>Moab,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 King: 3</note> it is ſet downe that theſe three Kings went to <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizeus,</hi> to enquire of him, concerning the word of the Lord. <hi>Elizeus</hi> ſayde vnto them, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord: ye ſhall neither ſee winde, nor rayne, yet the vally ſhall be filled with water, that ye may drinke, both ye, and your cattle, and your beaſtes.</hi> And in the morning, the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies and the ditches, were filled with water.

Remember Abraham, Iſaac, and

But let vs obſerue here the chiefe poynt, that God knowing well how he might be moued by the requeſt of his ſeruant <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Hiſtorie reporteth that God ſpake after this ſort vnto <hi>Moſes,</hi> in the tenth verſe, <hi>Let me alone, that my wrath maie waxe hote againſt them, for</hi> I <hi>will conſume them.</hi> Wherefore ſaith he, <hi>Let me?</hi> But that <hi>Moſes</hi> held him as it were by the armes, and bound his handes by his prayers, to the ende that hee ſhoulde not deſtroy them, euen as one will holde a man incenced with chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, that hee ſtriketh not another, or elſe tie faſt his armes, and his hands to repreſſe him. As indeede the deuoute prayers, and ardent inuocations of the ſeruaunts of God, are euen bondes and chaines, which tieth, and chaineth, the furie and indignation of the Lord, being prouoked againſt the ſinnes and tranſgreſſions of men, and many places bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth witneſſe in the ſcripture, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſheweth it diuerſe wayes, O immortall God, what heart is ſo hard whoſe intrailes

                  </hi> which they did. We anſwer, that all which they did, muſt not be attributed to their perſons (for they were men as we are) but vnto their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie: And becauſe it pleaſeth God to ſend vs forth to be meſſengers of his worde, as he did them, why ſhould not that honor which
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:9089:151"/> was attributed to their miniſtrie, be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ours, becauſe that is all one? There is onely this difference, that the grace of God was more plentifully powred forth by them, then by vs: and therefore, we muſt ad, that as the grace of God was more amply declared by them, ſo alſo a greater honor was due vnto them: euen ſo now at this day hee muſt bee moſt honoured, vnto whome God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated moſt graces, otherwiſe hee that will not do it, muſt be reckoned vnthanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnto the goodneſſe of God. Moreouer if he that is inferior to another, be greeued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is not ſo much reuerenced, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored as he that doth excell him in gifts (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be both of the ſame function) we ſay that he is to bee accounted a proude, and enuious man. But alſo we muſt conſider, that ſeeing that God will bee ſerued by our Miniſtrie, as he was by that of the Prophets and Apoſtles, it pleaſeth him alſo that wee ſhould be accounted of, as they were, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the meaſure of graces, which it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him to diſtribute to euery one. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that the Preachers now at this day, haue not ſuch a fulneſſe of gifts, as they had to do ſuch miraculous things, neuertheleſſe, hauing the charge of preaching his worde, when it pleaſeth him, he may furniſh them with ſuch graces, as they may performe the

It might alſo be obiected, that we ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite ſomething done by them, which were a matter of no great difficultie. For all they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whome God hath giuen eyes to ſee more clearely, then the ſimple people, may beare ſufficient witneſſe, that in theſe latter times, God hath rayſed vp ſome extraordinarllye vnto the holy miniſtrie, who hath done as miraculous things, as thoſe of the Prophets and Apoſtles. Not many yeares are paſſed ſince the whole world was plunged in groſſe darkeneſſe, and ignoraunce, ſo that it was a hard thing to ſay, whither there was a church, or the doctrine of Ieſus Chriſt or no. They themſelues which hadde the charge to teach others, had theyr eyes ſo cloſed vp with thoſe errors with which the world was inwrapped, that they confirmed others in their errors, thinking that there was no other truth, then that which they ſette forth, in ſuch ſort, that it ſeemed an impoſſible thing, to cauſe any ſpark of light to appeare amongſt theſe dark cloudes, yet neuertheleſſe, God in a moment then when euery one thought leaſt vppon it, God ſtirred vp ſome of his ſeruants, who beeing indued with the motions of his holy ſpirit, they Preached his holy worde more purely, then before, and by wrighting, and liuely voice, in a ſhort time ſo much abuſes,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:9089:152"/> ſuch corruption, both in the doctrine and manners of all ſorts of men, and principally, of thoſe that had the place of teaching others were reformed: <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  </hi> it is a hard thing to ſpeak, or rather to beleeue, how many Empires, Kingdomes, Monarchies, and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, beeing couered and buried in theſe corruptions and accurſed errors, were by the Miniſtrie of the ſeruants of God inlightned, yea &amp; finally, drawne out of theſe deepe pits of darknes. And that which is more admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that God in the beginning hauing ſtirred vp a ſimple Munk, hath by him alone foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and pronouncing his word, and by his writing, ſhaken all the foundations of the Babilonicall Empire, and that in a ſhort time, which a man would haue thought had bin ſufficiently defended, againſt all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries of future ages.<note place="margin">Pleſsis in his treatiſe of the church.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N truth now, beeing in the way liuely to exhort the youth to take vpon them this holy charge, from which they may be diſcouraged by reaſon of the infinite difficulties which are preſented be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, wee doo it the more willingly,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:9089:153"/> becauſe wee deſire nothing more then the glorie of God, and the ſaluation of our Brethren, both which, cannot bee better furthered then by this charge. But alas, which way ſhall I beginne? The beautie, dignitie, and incomparable profite of the ſame, ought to be as ſharpe ſpurres, to ſtirre vppe euerie one. When one deſireth that ſome ſhoulde applie themſelues vnto thoſe things, which doo appeare ſo good in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſhew, to allure and draw men there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, it is verie neceſſarie to vſe many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and arguments, to bring them thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and to pricke them forward: but in things that be of themſelues maruailous, excellent, and verie profitable, euerie one ought to embrace them of his owne accord. There is no lightneſſe ſo glorious, as that of the Miniſtrie, there is no calling, to bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared thereunto, in dignitie and profite: wherof then commeth it to paſſe, that many do ſo little regard it? <hi>Plato</hi> hath ſayde that vertue is ſo fayre, that if her beautie could be diſcerned with theſe corporall eyes, it would prouoke great loue of itſelf: what difference is there between the beauty of the miniſtrie,<note place="margin">A confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the obiection of the ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</note> and <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  </hi> of morall vertue? if one would propoſe vnto himſelf the litle reckoning &amp; account, which is ordinarily made of miniſters, hee would deteſt the ſame: we anſwer <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  </hi> this is the
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:9089:154"/> obiection of an ambitious man, and to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect this ambition, thou muſt ſet before thy eyes, that the honour which thou doſt deſire and gape after, it is worldly and vaine. And if it bee ſo, thou wanteſt iudgement in deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it, and in that thou ſheweſt the follie and vanitie of thy minde. Further, thou muſt conſider, that the honour which thou dreameſt of, to be in ſome other calling, is often times troubleſome, greeuous, which is deare before it bee gotten, and hard to bee kept. He that will be a phiſitian, how many trauailes &amp; cares muſt he paſſe through? how often muſt he watch in the night, before he can attaine his purpoſe, &amp; when he thinketh that he hath attained it, how muſt he toile &amp; labor to be knowne, &amp; to be had in eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? when he is once knowne, &amp; ſought after for his skill, is he then more quiet &amp; at reſt? muſt he not ſometime riſe out of his bed to help his patient? he muſt make haſte, he muſt ride in poſt many times with the daunger of the loſſe of his own health: what more? whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to viſit his patient, what ſauours is he conſtrained to ſmel? &amp; the better to know the qualitie of <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi> diſeaſe, &amp; the iſſue therof, he muſt ſomtime view the verie excrements of the ſick man, and taſte them: what pleaſure I pray you, or what delight ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he take in that? doth the lawyer endure leſſe trauels? doth he
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:9089:154"/> enioy his honors with more peace and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quilitie of the minde? how many times in the day, doth one or other come &amp; knock at his gate, and breake his head with ſolliciting his matter, which hee hath committed vnto his hand? Moreouer, thou muſt conſider, that all theſe affayres for which they are ſo tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and continually vexed, they are about earthly things, and ſo conſequently, all the honor &amp; profit which they get by the ſame, is tranſitory, and vaniſh away as the ſmoake. To conclude, meditate thou vpon this, for thy comfort, that thou art honoured in the adminiſtration of thy miniſterie, of all thoſe that are wiſe, and feare God: and ſeeing that is the true honour, which commeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> good men, and not from ſenſual men, we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that thou haſt more honor then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For in truth, the honour that is receiued from men well inſtructed, is to be preferred before that which is giuen of the ignorant. But of all things propound before thee, that thou art honoured of God. For the ſcripture ſpeaking of the Preachers of the word, doth teach vs, that Chriſt hath ſaid: <hi>Whoſoeuer ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noreth you, honors me, &amp;c.</hi> In this world when we are honoured of Kings and Princes, and great Lords, we make more account of that honour, then of that which wee receiue from thoſe that be inferiors, becauſe that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:9089:155"/> that they are that honoureth vs, ſo ought their honour to be priſed and valued. Seing then God doth ſo honour Miniſters and theyr Miniſtrie, that hee attributeth that honour vnto them, which is giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelfe: wherefore doſt thou that art a Paſtor, take care for the honour of men? And if thou doſt adde hereunto, thoſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable titles which are giuen vnto faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Paſtors, thou wouldeſt make leſſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the honour of the world, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme more the incomparable honour of the miniſtrie. But if any other ſhall obiect, that therefore he is diſcouraged, becauſe that the Miniſters for the moſt part are poore, needy, and in miſerie, we anſwere that this is the obiection of a couetous man:<note place="margin">A confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the obiection of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous.</note> and to correct this vice of couetouſneſſe, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der on the other ſide, that they that haue more meanes to liue by, then other, yet they alſo bee poore: and further, that pouertie is no vice, but that it is as acceptable vnto God of it ſelfe, as riches, when as well the one as the other doo come from GOD, if they bee vſed as they ought.</p>
               <p>Secondly, think with thy ſelf, that there is at this day, almoſt no men, which are addicted to any other ſtudy, as to any arte mechanick, who doo finde more eaſily, honeſt conditions
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:9089:155"/> to liue, then thoſe that haue giuen them ſelues to the ſtudie of diuinitie, as wee haue ſeene within this ſeuen or eight yeares, that many Phiſitians, Lawyers, Aduocates, Proc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, Notaries, many marchants, many great Lordes and gentlemen, beeing gone out of <hi>France,</hi> and other places, are conſtrained to trauaile vp and downe in ſtrange Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and haue ſuffered much want, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they haue beene skilfull in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and haue beene rich at home, but thoſe that haue ſtudied diuinitie, haue founde alwaies many commodities to ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the rigour of theyr exile. Thirdly, conſider, that if they haue not ſuch goods, and richeſſe, as many Marchaunts, Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, and other men of trades in this world, that God hath giuen vnto them a contented life, which is accompanied with godlineſſe, and the feare of God.</p>
               <p>In the fourth place, thou muſt meditate, that GGD is the plentifull rewarder of all the Miniſters of GOD, and thou muſt thinke vppon all thoſe excellent promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of GOD, which hee maketh in his worde, to nouriſh all liuing creatures. For if hee feedeth the beaſtes of the fielde, he will much more nouriſh men, and if he nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth all men, much more the faithfull,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:9089:156"/> and principally thoſe whom he hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, for the teaching and leading of them. To make an ende of this point, ſette before thine eyes, that if they abound not in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, and earthly goods: yet they are riche in the knowledge of the word of God, in the vnderſtanding, and reuealing of his ſecrets, which are the true riches of the ſoule: and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that thoſe be the true riches, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider that the more thou aboundeſt with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the more thou art truly rich: for theſe riches wil bring vnto thee ſo much ioy and gladneſſe, as the corporall and worldly goods, doo bring vnto them that poſſeſſe them, griefe, and care, and ſo enioying theſe true and ſincere ſpirituall rithes, why doſt thou take ſuch thought for the riches of this world? If another doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,<note place="margin">A confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe that loue plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</note> that his heart is pulled downe, becauſe that miniſters are ordinarily ſorowfull, pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue, full of care and melancholy, I may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mande of him, why are they more then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men? Theſe bee vaine and imaginarie fanſies, forged in the braine, of I knowe not what worldly men, for they are as ioyfull as other, and it is as lawfull for them as for any other. It is true, it is their dutie to be ſage, wiſe, prudent, modeſt, graue, and honeſt, but this doth not hinder them, but that they may vſe a moderate ioy, and agreeable to their vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: and on the contrary, this ioy doth
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:9089:156"/> bring more contentation, as it differeth from the reioycing of the prophane. <hi>Seneca</hi> ſayth in a certaine place, that we muſt gouerne our ſelues in ſuch ſort, that none may think vs too ſeuere, and again, that none deſpiſe vs, as thoſe that be vile &amp; contemptible, &amp; that we muſt more delight in profitable matters, then in things that be rediculous: &amp; he addeth, that one may mingle ſometime amongſt graue &amp; ſerious matters, thoſe things that be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, but we muſt take heed that they bee ſo tempered, that they do not diſcredit their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. If this bee ſo, who is he that thinketh the Paſtor worthie of reprehenſion, if ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time vpon occaſion he vſeth pleaſant words, and full of delight (which are more the ſignes of gentleman-like nature, then of any vice) ſeeing that it is proper and naturall to great and rare perſonages to haue (as it is ſayd in the common prouerb) ſome grace in theyr ſpeech? But ſome will obiect that they muſt of neceſſitie abſtaine from many plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, which are lawfull to others, which be in other callings. Lette vs demaunde of them againe what they bee, if one ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineth that they ought not to vſe the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall pleaſures, which are, to drinke, to eate ſoberlie, and many ſuch like, which our outward ſenſes do enioy, he may bee anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that it is lawful for them to vſe them, as it
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:9089:157"/> was for the Patriarches, Prophets, Apoſtles, and Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe, who was preſent at a marriage, and at banquets, and had the fruition of theſe ordinarie thinges, as well as any other. If any meane thoſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures which are vnprofitable and ſuperfluous, he may be anſwered, that theſe pleaſures are proper vnto Epicures, &amp; are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to brute beaſts. If one vnderſtands carnall pleaſures, as to gourmandize, and to be drunken, and to bee riotous in exceſſe, in which ſenſuall men doo take theyr pleaſure, hee may bee aunſwered, that theſe bee the pleaſures of voluptuous men, and that ſuch pleaſures be of their owne nature ſo filthie, deteſtable, and infamous, that when they are once na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, they ought to bee abhorred, by reaſon of thoſe infinite miſchiefes which they draw after them, without making any mention of the ſhame, ſorrow, and repentance, which doo ordinarily accompanie them. But lette vs oppoſe vnto theſe, that they may conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually poſſeſſe the ioy of the ſpirit, which is the true ioy, I mean the vnderſtanding of the holy ſcripture, the meditations of the ſame, the reuelation of the great ſecrets of God:<note place="margin">Rom. 24. Gal. 5.</note> this is the ioy of the holy ghoſt, of which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh, and mention is made in all the worde of GOD. This is the ioy with which the Angels are ſatiſfied, and
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:9089:157"/> reioyce with all the elect and faythfull that may bee, the which is ioy with out co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon what can any deſire that is greater? and why ſhoulde any bee leſſe affectionate,<note place="margin">A confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the obiection of thoſe that be carefull.</note> to the ſtudie of the Miniſtrie, if that hee bee but depriued of thoſe pleaſures which are prophane and vnlawfull. Finally, if another ſhall ſay, that hee is kept backe from dedicating of himſelfe vnto the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie, becauſe that Miniſters are ſubiect vnto infinite daungers, we aunſwere, that this is the replie of a coward, and of a faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted man: wee may oppoſe againſt this, that princes, gentlemen, ſouldiers, marchants,<note place="margin">Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome vpon the ſecond of Mathew.</note> and euerie condition of men, doo not liue more ſafely. The higher that Princes are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted, the more they are aſſailed with feare and continuall dangers. Alwaies (ſaith <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi>) a great ſtate is ſubiect to great feare, as the bowes of trees, <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi> higher that they are, the more are they ſhaken with euery little puffe of wind that bloweth, ſo thoſe that are exalted vnto the top of the greateſt honors, are often times troubled, &amp; do imagine their eſtate almoſt deſperate, not onely by euerie ſmall report of bad newes <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  </hi> may bee brought vnto them, but alſo they are oftentimes in daily feare of them, which are appointed for the protection of their perſon. The gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is no leſſe aſſured, neither in peace nor
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:9089:158"/> war. In peace it is moſt certain, that he muſt ſuffer and indure many paines and troubles, in conuerſing with them, with whom hee hath any thing to doo, and this likewiſe is common to euerie condition of man. In warre, amongſt the torments of mind which he may haue (if it may be called the torment of the minde) hee muſt bee readie to finde out his Prince, and to obey in all things that it pleaſeth him to commaunde him. To be briefe, he muſt not ſtay at his own houſe, for otherwiſe hee may bee counted a carter, or one that keepeth the chimnie corner, or els he may fall into ſome other mark of infamie The eſtate of the ſouldiour is nothing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for hee is compaſſed with ſo many dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, that euerie houre hee ſhall putte his life in hazard, ſeeing that hee muſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time go to the aſſault, ſometime to the skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh, ſometime to the battaile, ſometime to the breach, and many other encounters, which death many times follows hard at the heeles. The Marchant liueth not more ſafely, but with more feare and trembling. How dooth hee quake for feare many times, when hee goeth vppe and downe to fayres, is hee not conſtrained to paſſe through woods and forreſts? It ſeemeth vnto him, that he alwaies beholdeth theeues and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers after his taile, to rob him of his treaſure,
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:9089:158"/> and ſometime to cut his throate, and that not without cauſe, becauſe he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly ſpieth out ſuch in his way. Is he in greater ſecuritie vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the ſea? The pyrats, and other ſpies, lye alwaies in wait to catch him, without making any mention of the tempeſts, and ſtormye weather, vnto which, they are continually expoſed, and are not far from death, but euen the breadth of two ynches, as one of the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers hath ſaid. To be briefe, euery man, of what art or miſterie ſo euer hee be, is he not ſubiect to many hazards, yea vnto more then the miniſters are? becauſe that they commonly ſtaying with theyr flocke, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their calling, are in more ſafetie then thoſe that trauaile hither and thither? But if it ſo fall out, that they be in daunger when they are with their flocke, in the middeſt or nigh to the aduerſaries of the truth, there is none of their faithfull hearers, but that will vſe all <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi> meanes they can, yea and ve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter their liues for the preſeruation of theyr perſon, as we haue ſeene many times in <hi>France,</hi> and in other places, that many haue bin preſerued by theſe means. When they are in the army, their vocation is to preach, to aduiſe, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh, and principally to be neare vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand, &amp; not to go &amp; ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at al en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ters, as captains, &amp; ſouldiers, &amp; other muſt do, according to their duty, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, they
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:9089:159"/> are not inuironed with ſo many dangers as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men are. Further, propoſe vnto thy ſelf, that if they indure any afflictions, or torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of the minde, that it is for the honor of God. And conſider that if Princes, Noble men, &amp; Artizans, do ſuffer voluntarily an infinit marterdome, one for ambition, the other for couetouſneſſe, an other I know not for what vanities, much more, none ought to feare, or to doubt at all to bee troubled, or to ſuffer ſhipwracke, euen of life it ſelfe, for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement of the glory of God, and for the ſaluation of his brethren, which are things ſo rare, and ſo precious, that the ſonne of God doubted not to ſhed his bloud for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. What ioy and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort may come vnto them by theſe ſufferings, for which the Apoſtles and other of the faithfull reioyced ſo much? What man is ſo eloquent, that can expreſſe this in words? But for thy ſouereigne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, ſet before thee, that he whom thou ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt, is ſtrong, &amp; mightie, for to defend thee againſt any thing that may happen: who is thy rocke, thy buckler, thy Tower, and who will neuer forſake thee in time of need. God ſaith by his Prophet,<note place="margin">Zach. 2</note> 
                  <hi>That he that toucheth the faithfull, toucheth the apple of his eie.</hi> Hee ſpeaketh this of all the faithfull in generall: how much more then, doth hee vnderſtand the Paſtors, whome he hath ordained to be
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:9089:159"/> guides vnto others. In mans body there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that we do ſo charily regarde, as the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the eye, becauſe that is the guide of the other members. If then the Paſtors bee the apples of the eies of God, that is, thoſe whom he loueth, and keepeth as his onely treaſure, who doubteth, but that he hath more care in preſeruing them, then wee haue in keeping our ſight? To conclude, if any man oppoſeth whatſoeuer he can, or what hee may deuiſe or inuent, as obſtacles and hinderaunces to diſſwade any from the loue of the miniſterie of the word of God: we know alſo that there are ſufficient aunſwers to confute him, and which are of more force by the grace of God to inflame them that haue any heart at all (if they can vnderſtand them) that no reaſons can be alleaged to diſcourage them. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, let vs beſeech the Lorde God, with an ardent heart, and deuout minde, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the miniſterie is a diuine and ſpirituall thing, and men by nature ſenſuall, and giuen vnto the world, that it would pleaſe him by vertue of the holy Ghoſt, to roote out of diuers mens hearts, theſe carnall and wordly affections, and plant, and as it were imprint in them, a holy deſire of applying themſelues moſt earneſtly vnto this holy vocation: that he would vouchſafe, to inflame our hearts more and more, with the fire of his holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:9089:160" rendition="simple:additions"/> and ſo forme and faſhion them, that they ſhall not neede any further helpe. Finally, that he would direct and guide them, that they may be able to finiſh and accompliſh theyr courſes, in ſuch ſort, that the efficacie and power thereof, may redounde vnto the reſtoring of many Kingdomes vnto Chriſt, yea euen vnto the renewing of the face of the whole earth, the whole being done for the ſingular comfort of the faithful, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally, for the aduancement of Gods glory: to whome bee all honour, praiſe and glory, both now and euermore. <hi>Amen.</hi>
