            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And this is Å¿o much the more neceÅ¿Å¿arie, becauÅ¿e nowe Å¿innes and wickedneÅ¿Å¿e of the people are more great and horrible, then the ages heretofore. When <hi>EÅ¿ay, Ieremy, Ezechiel,</hi> and the other prophets would reprehend the malice and impenitencie of men in their time, they were wont to reckon vppe particularly thoÅ¿e tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ions and Å¿innes, which at that time bore the Å¿way, to the end that they might make them aÅ¿ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med which too freely did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mit the Å¿ame, and afteward hauing as it were touched them to the quicke, and euen pearced their inwarde Å¿oule, they cauÅ¿ed them to vnderÅ¿tand, that with all their heart they deÅ¿ired their conuerÅ¿ion and reformation, vnto the which they Å¿o Å¿eriouÅ¿ly did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort them. AmongÅ¿t all the notable places in which this may bee moÅ¿t clearely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, that of the prophet <hi>Micheas</hi> is one, in the Å¿euenth Chapter of his PropheÅ¿ie,<note place="margin">Mich. 7</note> where moÅ¿t lamentably complaining of the corruptions which then raigned, he bringeth in God, Å¿peaking after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.

If we will Å¿pend but a little time to conÅ¿ider this deÅ¿cription of vices, and compare them with the Å¿ins of our age, wee Å¿hall finde, that our age doth farre exceede, for Å¿o much, as not onely the fulfilling of all the filthineÅ¿Å¿e of Å¿inne
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:9089:8"/> (of which the Prophet dooth Å¿o much complaine) may be Å¿eene amongÅ¿t vs, but it doth Å¿o Å¿uperabound, that in auncient times, feare and Å¿hame (which are two Å¿trong bridles to retaine men in Å¿ome Å¿ort in their dutie, or at the leaÅ¿t to make them aÅ¿hamed of their faults) at this day are broken, and take no more place, but that which is worÅ¿e, they are by an incredible wickedneÅ¿Å¿e of men, turned into a kinde of diÅ¿ordered licentiouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e, that euerie one is Å¿o paÅ¿t Å¿hame, that he committeth Å¿inne with a certaine pleaÅ¿ure and delight of the heart, in Å¿uch manner, that he thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it not to be euill.

Such is the behauiour of the moÅ¿t parte of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the earth, who, although there be nothing more deformed and monÅ¿trous then vice of his owne nature, nothing which may make men more to tremble for

This is a moÅ¿t forcible reaÅ¿on, for in truth, euen as Emperours, Monarches, and Kings of this world, do excell others in power, riches, credite and authority, Å¿o alÅ¿o ought they to Å¿urpaÅ¿Å¿e others in all kinde of vertues: as wee Å¿ee in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, that as the Sunne is greater then all the other Å¿tarres, Å¿o it doth farre Å¿urmount them in brightneÅ¿Å¿e. If it commeth to paÅ¿Å¿e, that kings do exceed others in vice and diÅ¿order, what may bee expected of the moÅ¿t part of the Å¿ubiects, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly follow the example of their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but that they delight in corruption, and eÅ¿trange themÅ¿elues from God? As in the contrarie, if Princes giue themÅ¿elues
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:9089:11"/> to the Å¿tudie of vertue, and that it Å¿hine in them as it ought, wee may conceiue hope, that there light will kindle others to follow them. NeuertheleÅ¿Å¿e, this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on is not of Å¿o great weight, becauÅ¿e God manie tymes doo giue good Kinges, yet their Subiects are not bettered ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by: and as Å¿ometymes there may bee a good people, but a wicked King, who is nothing amended by the honeÅ¿t life of his Subiects. VVherefore we muÅ¿t conclude, that this dooth depende vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the prouidence of GOD, who as hee holdeth the hearts of Kinges in his hande: Å¿o likewiÅ¿e, the heart of the people, to learne and encline them whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Å¿oeuer hee pleaÅ¿eth, and conÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that is not the true meanes, or neareÅ¿t waye to purge the worlde of Å¿in. There be others that are of opinion, that all men in generall, and euerie one in particular, muÅ¿t beginne to bee diÅ¿plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed with their Å¿innes. For God hauing created all creatures to bee knowne of them to be Å¿erued and worÅ¿hipped as the Creator, if it Å¿hall come to paÅ¿Å¿e, that man which being <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

But if euerie one could amend himÅ¿elfe, and vnfainedly deteÅ¿t his wicked life, and addict himÅ¿elfe to the knowledge of God, to Å¿et forth his praiÅ¿es, as they are bounde by the lawe of nature, and of their creation Å¿ome hope might be conceiued, that the earth in Å¿ome Å¿ort Å¿hould be reformed. But becauÅ¿e the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people is a filthie beaÅ¿t, blockiÅ¿h, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, following their owne fancie in the manner of their life, who will neuer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue that which is not anÅ¿werable to their owne affections, there is no likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of reformation and amendment of life in this reÅ¿pect.

And in another place, where hee Å¿aith, that Nature her Å¿elfe hath inwrapped great things within great difficulties. But to vnderÅ¿tand theÅ¿e two poynts more eaÅ¿ily, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der each of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> we comprehend al that which the Å¿cripture Å¿etteth down, touching dignity and labor: that is, vnder the name of dignitie
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:9089:21"/> we vnderÅ¿tand all thoÅ¿e excellent titles, with which PaÅ¿tors are adorned in the worde of God, the which titles appertained in ancient time, to the Prophets, PrieÅ¿ts, and ApoÅ¿tles: not that it is our meaning to Å¿ay, that in al things paÅ¿tors be like vnto prophets, prieÅ¿ts, and ApoÅ¿tles, without any exception: we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erue vnto them that which was proper and peculiar vnto themÅ¿elues, and which cannot be giuen vnto them which nowe preach the word, as to the prophets to tell of things to come, the which God by an eÅ¿peciall priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, hath reuealed vnto them by a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull maner: vnto prieÅ¿ts to offer Å¿acrifice, and to performe other ceremonies, which were commaunded in the law: and to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿tles to be Å¿ent hither and thither, into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places, to make plaine the will of theyr maÅ¿ter, and to doo miracles, as they did, both for the confirmation of the doctrine of the truth: but we do onely attribute to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tors that are nowe, all thoÅ¿e excellent titles which do commend their miniÅ¿try, becauÅ¿e they are theyr Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ors, in the publiÅ¿hing of the Å¿ame worde, which alÅ¿o appertaineth vnto them by right, becauÅ¿e that the holy Å¿cripture doth honour them with the Å¿ame ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles in many places, as wee Å¿hall Å¿ee in theyr place, that vnder dignity and excellencie we put that they are called, <hi>MimiÅ¿ters of God,

AlÅ¿o vnder difficulty, we comprehend the great trauaile and diligence which muÅ¿t be employed in that Å¿tudie, to doo beÅ¿t good in their charge, with moÅ¿t edifying: alÅ¿o all thoÅ¿e troubles and afflictions, which they vÅ¿ually Å¿uffer, that is, iniuries, raylings, reproaches, dangers, vnto which they are often Å¿ubiect, during the whole courÅ¿e of their calling. Let vs Å¿peake then nowe of theÅ¿e two points, according to order, that is, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3</note> that it is a worthy worke: when he Å¿peaketh thereof, hee maketh a little preface, to make them more attentiue, to whome hee writeth this EpiÅ¿tle, that they might the rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ider, that hee intreateth there not of an ordinary or common matter, but of a graue and Å¿erious thing, as greater cannot be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. This is that which he touched in many
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:9089:22"/> of his EpiÅ¿tles, that alwaies when he entreth into a matter of great conÅ¿equence, to make the faithfull to know, that they Å¿hould deeply conÅ¿ider that thing which he Å¿heweth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, as in the Å¿ame EpiÅ¿tle, teaching that IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t is the Sauior and redeemer of the world: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he Å¿aith it, he vÅ¿eth this introductio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>. This is a true Å¿aying, and by all meanes woorthy to be receiued, that ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us came into the world to Å¿aue Å¿inners, of which I am cheefe. AlÅ¿o in the fourth Chapter of the Å¿ame E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piÅ¿tle, hauing Å¿ayd, That GodlineÅ¿Å¿e was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for all things, and that it had the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿es of this life preÅ¿ent, and of that which is to come. He addeth the better to perÅ¿wade, that this was a true Å¿aying, and by all meanes worthy to be receiued: that is, that godlines had the promiÅ¿es both of this, &amp; of that other life.<note place="margin">2.

Hee addeth, This is a true Å¿ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for if wee be dead with him, we Å¿hall alÅ¿o liue with him. And in many other places hee vÅ¿eth the Å¿ame manner of teaching, the which is very profitable, principally for this reaÅ¿on, rhat when we would maruailouÅ¿ly moue any body, then when wee teach them Å¿ome point
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:9089:22"/> of doctrine, worthy the marking, and neceÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿arie to be vÅ¿ed for diuers vÅ¿es, if we vÅ¿e after this maner a certaine gentle inÅ¿inuation, we profite much more, then when we enter pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ently to the vnfolding of the doctrine, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any forme of preparation, as if we handle any common matter. Therefore let vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that Å¿eeing that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> entring into the diÅ¿courÅ¿e of this calling, Å¿o woorthy and excellent, doth make a notable Preface, to note as it were by the way, the dignitie and beautie of the Å¿ame, that all they in whome God hath grafted this holy deÅ¿ire to dedicate themÅ¿elues into it, Å¿hould thinke, and thinke againe in themÅ¿elues, what they take in hand: I meane, what Å¿ingular honour God doth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer vnto them, that they may take the more pain in preparing themÅ¿elues, and to be pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked forward thereunto, that they daily Å¿ette before their eies thoÅ¿e excellent titles, with which they are adorned in the holy Å¿crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: by the teÅ¿timonies whereof, it is very conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t, firÅ¿t to proue the Å¿ame, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to dilate vppon them in the maner of an exhortation.</p>

In mans body there is nothing more deare then the apple of the eyes, &amp; of purpoÅ¿e God hath giuen vnto vs nothing Å¿o precious as that: for although all the partes of our body bee moÅ¿t excellent, that the great PhiloÅ¿ophers being aÅ¿toniÅ¿hed at the maruailous workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip of them, haue confeÅ¿Å¿ed that this worke could not be from man, but that it was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine: but of all the reÅ¿t, the eyes are the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall partes, becauÅ¿e they are the guides of the other members, and without which men are as miÅ¿erable as <hi>Polyphemus</hi> was, when his one eye was put out. Euen Å¿o, Å¿eeing that in the body of the Church, the PaÅ¿tors bee the eyes, and the light of the Å¿ame, they that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ire to be Å¿uch eyes, they ought not only with great care and diligence, to get this light, but hauing gotten it, charitably to preferre, and daily increaÅ¿e the Å¿ame, to enlighten them that are in darkeneÅ¿Å¿e, and breefely to take heed, that it be not diminiÅ¿hed and ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿hed in them, becauÅ¿e that if it bee quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched or darkened in them which deÅ¿ire to be, or be already <hi>Seers,</hi> it is to bee feared, that it will bee the cauÅ¿e of as much miÅ¿chiefe,

But how commeth it to paÅ¿Å¿e, that they come not onelie to bee bleare eyed, but darkeneÅ¿Å¿e, and blindneÅ¿Å¿e it Å¿elfe? This happeneth when they are puffed vp with pride, with carnal opinions, &amp; vaine fantaÅ¿ies, with which they Å¿uffer themÅ¿elues to be led, &amp; lead with them all thoÅ¿e that hearken vnto them, vnto their owne deÅ¿truction. Hitherto may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿o bee added, that if thoÅ¿e that bee igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt, bee not kept backe from this charge, it will fall out by them, as it dooth by thoÅ¿e that hath badde eyes, and hauing a deÅ¿ire to drawe neare vnto the Sunne, are offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the light thereof, and in daunger of looÅ¿ing their Å¿ight altogether: and that which is more to bee feared, through their negligence, (which beeing vnfitte, intrudeth themÅ¿elues into this charge) they do commit a double fault: that is to Å¿ay, in that they ouerthrowe themÅ¿elues, and others guided by them: that they deÅ¿erue a double puniÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: becauÅ¿e of their want of experience, they knowe not howe to gouerne the flocke of GOD, the which they lead by Bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and Briers, and through deÅ¿art pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in Å¿teade of fayre wayes.

And beeing proude of this vaine honour, with what cheerefulneÅ¿Å¿e, &amp; willingneÅ¿Å¿e doth he Å¿erue his Lord? What doth he omit whereby he may gratifie him? What then ought they to doo, which haue this honour, to bee

               <p>And as concerning theÅ¿e foure titles which are here ioyned together, wee will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound them all in one, and Å¿hewe what they ought to learne, who will exceede them in their places.

But the better to vnderÅ¿tand what the one and the other were, wee muÅ¿t Å¿peake of each of them Å¿euerallie. The ApoÅ¿tles were men tried, and choÅ¿en, whome God indued with moÅ¿t heauenly graces, and elected them in a Å¿oueraigne decree of honour: Å¿uch were the twelue ApoÅ¿tles, vnto which number Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was after receiued. Next were the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliÅ¿ts, becauÅ¿e their charge did draw neareÅ¿t to the ApoÅ¿tles, but they were vnlike vnto them in degree of dignine.

Let this the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> be diligently marked, of all them <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  </hi> intend the profeÅ¿hon of the MiniÅ¿trie, to take heed
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:9089:32"/> of theÅ¿e two extremities: the firÅ¿t is, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being <hi>Doctors,</hi> nor <hi>PaÅ¿tors,</hi> that is, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no gifts in any meaÅ¿ure, to exerciÅ¿e this holie calling, that they ought not to goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to intrude themÅ¿elues. The other is, that although they haue Å¿ome gifts for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of this charge, yet they muÅ¿t daylie learne to knowe their weakeneÅ¿Å¿e, to the ende, that by the knowledge thereof, they may be humbled more and more: that when they Å¿hall perceiue their fellowe brethren and companions, to excell them in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and vnderÅ¿tanding of the Scripture, and of other Å¿ciences, that they reuerence them, and giue honour vnto them, as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to VeÅ¿Å¿els which God hath preferred before them: and aboue all, that they bee free from enuying them. And hauing Å¿ome opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of themÅ¿elues, they muÅ¿t not thinke that they doo Å¿urpaÅ¿Å¿e them, but that they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge with humilitie to bee inferiour vnto them: and let them conÅ¿ider, that if they bee not <hi>ApoÅ¿tles,</hi> yet they are <hi>Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liÅ¿ts,</hi> and that although others go before them in gifts, yet neuertheleÅ¿Å¿e, that they are thoÅ¿e whome it hath pleaÅ¿ed God to appoynt to Å¿et forth his glorie: and that although others haue receiued more, yet they may be as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, according to that meaÅ¿ure of riches which GOD hath beÅ¿towed vpon them.

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:9089:33"/> as it were one thing. Behold then the frute which wee muÅ¿t gather of them of whom we Å¿peake: that is, that euen as when labourers doo manure their lande, and order it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Å¿eaÅ¿on, and as thoÅ¿e that keepe vineyards do dreÅ¿Å¿e theyr vines, to the ende that they may haue plentie of fruite, Å¿o thoÅ¿e that deÅ¿ire to haue the guiding of the Church of God, ought aduiÅ¿edly to conÅ¿ider, that they bee Å¿ufficiently prouided for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerment of the Å¿ame: aboue all, to bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to inÅ¿truct and teach, in plucking vp by the roots the brambles &amp; thornes which are verie thicke, weeding out as much as may be, the cockle, which groweth in great plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie with the good corne, and to cauÅ¿e it to bring foorth good and wholÅ¿ome fruites, according to the expectation of his Lorde: and that they take heede, that through their negligence, it bringeth not foorth baÅ¿tard and wilde Grapes, in Å¿teede of good and pleaÅ¿ant fruite. A Å¿imple husband-man, or Å¿ome other ignorant labourer, will take all paines that hee can to reape the profite of his grounde: what ought then the labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of the Church of GOD to doo in the field of God? Is it a thing to bee Å¿uffered, that eyther by theyr negligence it bee mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, or by their inÅ¿ufficiencie the profite thereof bee kept backe? Therefore after the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:9089:33"/> manner of labourers, they that deÅ¿ire this calling, they ought principally to endeuour night and day to make themÅ¿elues fit for the Å¿ame. Secondly, to Å¿ette the good plant of the worde of God, to water it in good time, that it may bring foorth fruite in aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunce, and when the time of the harueÅ¿t and gathering is come, the labourers may reioyce, and cheefely the expectation of the MaiÅ¿ter of the Vinyarde and of the fielde, may bee Å¿atiÅ¿fied, and haue occaÅ¿ion to prayÅ¿e them, to whome hee hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the ordering of his grounde, that they haue dealt faythfully: euen as Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who calleth himÅ¿elfe and his fellow labourers, <hi>Planters</hi> and <hi>VVaterers,</hi> but it was GOD that gaue increaÅ¿e to his holy worke.</p>
               <p>Lette vs go forwarde to the thirteenth, in that they are called labourers with GOD,<note place="margin">MiniÅ¿ters are called labourers with God.</note> this is, to giue them to vnderÅ¿tande, that honour which GOD giueth vnto them more particularly. For Å¿eeing that God can doo his owne worke himÅ¿elfe, who is Å¿o Å¿imple, that dooth not greatly wonder at Å¿o infinite bountie? Verily, it is Å¿o much the more to bee maruailed at, that wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing full of Å¿inne, are altogether vnwoorthie to come neere vnto him, not onely to bee the cheefe Å¿tones which Å¿houlde bee em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:9089:34"/> in the building of his Church, but not woorthie to bee the leaÅ¿t, bee it neuer Å¿o ragged and vnhewed, vntill he Å¿quareth vs, to make vs fitte for his holy building. And not onely hee contententh himÅ¿elfe with that, but hee exalteth vs euen Å¿o farre, that wee are called his fellow-labourers. Alas, who is it amongÅ¿t all them that addict themÅ¿elues to the Å¿tudie of the MiniÅ¿trie, that by the conceite of this mercifull kindneÅ¿Å¿e, is not rauiÅ¿hed with admiration? And beeing thus aÅ¿toniÅ¿hed, doo not Å¿triue with all his power, to acknowledge this Å¿o Å¿ingular goodneÅ¿Å¿e, and plainely confeÅ¿Å¿e, that all that hee worketh with GOD, proceedes not from his owne free-will, as Å¿ome dooth imagine, but that all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from GOD, and that hee is nothing elÅ¿e but an inÅ¿trument whome GOD Å¿tir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vppe by his Spirite, to doo his will. When the Scriuener holdeth the hande of the Childe whome hee teacheth to write, the Scholler cannot well attribute the thing written, to himÅ¿elfe, but to his MaiÅ¿ter which guided his hande: but the MaiÅ¿ter, for the better encouragement of his Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, may Å¿ay, that hee did write the Å¿ame. Euen Å¿o <hi>PaÅ¿tors,</hi> they are nothing in the woorke of the Lorde but inÅ¿truments, which are guided according to his will: but
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:9089:34"/> when they Å¿hall perceiue themÅ¿elues Å¿o ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured of GOD, what ingratitude is it, if they doo forgette and abuÅ¿e this incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable honour? Who is it amongÅ¿t men, that beeing of an inferiour degree, Å¿hall not perceiue himÅ¿elfe greatly to bee eÅ¿tee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, if hee bee called into the companie of Å¿ome Noble Lorde, and that this great Prince will not attempt any thing, before hee hath made him acquainted therewith? and alÅ¿o will attribute vnto him parte of the glorie of his noble actes and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous exploytes which hee hath doone, although hee hath doone nothing, or leÅ¿Å¿e then nothing, what vnthankfulneÅ¿Å¿e Å¿houlde there bee in Å¿uch an one, if hee woulde not make a vowe of perpetuall dutie vnto Å¿uch a Lorde, and Å¿triue as much as poÅ¿Å¿ibly hee can, to pleaÅ¿e and gratifie him?</p>
               <p>The vnthankfulneÅ¿Å¿e of them whome GOD hath called to the holie MiniÅ¿trie, Å¿houlde bee verie great, if they Å¿houlde bee Å¿o farre gone, as to forgette that goodneÅ¿Å¿e and title of Å¿ingular honour, with which he hath adorned them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Å¿uch ought to pray vnto God, to giue vnto them that grace, Å¿o to thinke of this honour, that the remembraunce thereof may bee a pricke vnto them, to Å¿tirre them
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:9089:35"/> to be diligent in the diÅ¿charge of dutie. The fourteenth is, that they are called <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pencers</hi>

               <p>To the ende then that they fall not into this inconuenience, they muÅ¿t watch night and day, to prepare themÅ¿elues to doo theyr dutie. The other is, that they fall not as it were, into the contrarie extremitie, that they regarde not too much to be praiÅ¿ed of the Å¿imple people, who Å¿ometimes for want of iudgement, when they perceiue Å¿ome one to make a great Å¿hewe in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, and to haue gotten the fauour of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, they by and by imagine, that they bee

But they ought to remember, that they are onely Å¿tewards, and diÅ¿penÅ¿ers of the wealth of God, and not giuers, and diÅ¿tributers of that which is their owne, and when the time Å¿hall come, they muÅ¿t giue an account of their Å¿te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardÅ¿hip, vnto him which hath placed them in that charge, of whome they Å¿hall be rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as they Å¿hall be found faithful, or vnfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:9089:53"/> which <hi>Cicero</hi> Å¿peaketh, which is the fountaine of all perturbations, that it is a reuolting, and an apoÅ¿tacy of the reaÅ¿on, and vnderÅ¿tanding: for it is Å¿o eÅ¿tranged from true reaÅ¿on, that it is impoÅ¿Å¿ible to gouerne, and containe by the Å¿ame, the appetites, and concupiÅ¿ences of the minde.

And for this cauÅ¿e, S. <hi>Ierome</hi> writing to <hi>Nepotian,</hi> admoniÅ¿hed him to auoide the banquettos of temporall men, and that it were better for him to dine in his owne houÅ¿e, then in a Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace. And to make an ende of this point, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brietie beeng Å¿o much commended to all the faithfull in many places of the Å¿cripture, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿ters ought Å¿o much the more to embrace the Å¿ame, by how much they haue the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ouer others.</p>

But wee may here note dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tly two points touching theÅ¿e two tongues, that as each of theÅ¿e tongues haue their diuers properties, Å¿o we muÅ¿t diligently obÅ¿erue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, if that we will haue the true and right vÅ¿e of them. The Greek tong hath this property, that it is Å¿o fruitfull and plentifull, this it Å¿ignifieth one and the Å¿elfe Å¿ame thing by many wordes, the which (beÅ¿ides many
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:9089:90"/> other Å¿ignifications which the Å¿ame words may haue, according to the diuerÅ¿itie of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and matters, which do occurre heere and there) Å¿ignifie alÅ¿o one thing, &amp; in this reÅ¿pect great heed muÅ¿t be taken hereof, that we doo not miÅ¿conceiue in Å¿earching the vnderÅ¿tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of euerie place. As touching <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi> Hebrew tongue, Å¿eeing that it hath a propertie quite contrarie to the Greeke (becauÅ¿e it hath ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie fewe words, but vnder the moÅ¿t parte of them, it comprehends many &amp; diuers things) wee muÅ¿t conÅ¿ider, that if we take in hand to expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>d Å¿ome places of Å¿cripture, we muÅ¿t not content our Å¿elues with one or two Å¿ignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of euery word, but that we do diligently marke the pluralitie of the Å¿ignifications of each word, according to the occurrences of matters: to the ende that wee may carrie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the moÅ¿t proper Å¿ignification of the place, as neere as may be: Å¿o that he that can obÅ¿erue this, and practiÅ¿e it, he may be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailouÅ¿ly eaÅ¿ed in the expoÅ¿ition of the Å¿crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: but contrariwiÅ¿e, he that Å¿atiÅ¿fieth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf with a Å¿imple and bad Å¿ignification of the greateÅ¿t part of words, without conÅ¿idering the varietie of euerie Å¿ubiect, it is certaine, that although Å¿ome one may attaine vnto a great knowledge in theÅ¿e tongues, yet he may be deceiued (as many are deceiued, &amp; do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>Å¿elues co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>monly in going no further)
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:9089:90"/> that thoÅ¿e that haue only a mean knowledge in them, doo obÅ¿erue with iudgement this diuerÅ¿itie, as often as they Å¿earch out the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derÅ¿tanding of any place. The Å¿econd point is, that it is not Å¿ufficient for a Preacher to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain vnto the vnderÅ¿ta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ding of thoÅ¿e tongues and to obÅ¿erue this diuerÅ¿itie: but alÅ¿o after that he hath found out a proper Å¿ignification, he muÅ¿t Å¿tudy with dexterity to expound the Å¿ame, with profit &amp; edification to the people. For if he want this dexteritie, it is certaine, that the knowledge which he hath gotten in the languages, is much leÅ¿Å¿e profitable, (as it may be Å¿eene in many, which are deÅ¿titute therof, although otherwiÅ¿e they haue experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the tongues) and for this cauÅ¿e, not onely the Å¿imple people, but alÅ¿o thoÅ¿e that haue more profited, are much more mooued and edified with Å¿uch kinde of teaching, then with the barren and ruder manner, as commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> experience Å¿heweth. And in truth, euen as it is not Å¿ufficient to Å¿ay, and to Å¿hewe, that Å¿uch a meate is good, or Å¿ome other thing is very profitable, if order bee not taken for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioying of the Å¿ame: Å¿o it is not enough for the Preacher (who is to inÅ¿truct a congregation compounded of duers Å¿orts of men) to tell Å¿imply <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi> meaning of Å¿ome place: but beÅ¿ides, he muÅ¿t know how to Å¿et forth the Å¿ame, and as it were to apparell it with neceÅ¿Å¿arie orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:9089:91"/> that the people may the better finde it out, and be better edified, which alone with the glorie of God, hee muÅ¿t propoÅ¿e before him. Wherefore to conclude this firÅ¿t point, the Preacher muÅ¿t Å¿tudie with all diligence for this, to attaine vnto his Å¿oundneÅ¿Å¿e of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, aboue all, in reading the holy Å¿crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture without ceaÅ¿ing, meditating in the Å¿ame vppon all occaÅ¿ions, pondering the Å¿ame day and night, if poÅ¿Å¿ibly he can, propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding before his eyes that notable Å¿aying o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But the greateÅ¿t hinderance that it cauÅ¿eth, is, that it hurteth the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t in performing her duties, which is to approoue, or diÅ¿alow of thoÅ¿e things which be in the memory, or of thoÅ¿e things which we reade.

For althogh men according to their wit, do deuiÅ¿e an infinit number of good &amp; excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t things, yet they muÅ¿t be praiÅ¿ed for knowledge, by

TheÅ¿e bee they of whom it is Å¿aid in a common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe, that their Å¿ciences are hidden MuÅ¿es, but Å¿uch as are of no account, becauÅ¿e that Å¿uch men hauing Å¿ome good gifts of God, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleÅ¿Å¿e, if others cannot be the better for them, they cannot be properly eÅ¿teemed for the greateÅ¿t learned men becauÅ¿e that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is not to be counted knowledge, when a man keepes it to himÅ¿elfe alone, and cannot impart it to others. But when a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> hath know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which doth many good, and that he can
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:9089:95"/> eaÅ¿ily co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>municate <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi> Å¿ame, he is fitly to be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a learned man. And it is very wel Å¿aid by an heathen Poet, <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi> it is nothing to know any thing for it Å¿elf, vnleÅ¿Å¿e another knoweth that which thou knoweÅ¿t, as though he wold Å¿ay, that otherwiÅ¿e it is not to be eÅ¿teemed for knowledge. But Å¿eeing that the marke and principall end of all knowledge, is to inÅ¿truct and to edifie, it followeth that the more a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> in vttering his knowledge, doth teach and benefit others, the more learned he is, and ought Å¿o to be accounted. Wherefore let vs conclude this point, that a Preacher Å¿hould not onely endeuour, to Å¿tirre vp his minde, and poliÅ¿h his tongue, with faire words, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,<note place="margin">The more plainly a man writes or Å¿peakes, the more learned is he to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted.</note> and delectable, but alÅ¿o, and principally, to fill his breaÅ¿t with the knowledge of many good and profitable things.

Finally, let vs adde, that a preacher being Å¿uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently furniÅ¿hed both wi h words &amp; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, of many good things, he Å¿hal attain vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an eaÅ¿ie kind of teaching, &amp; hauing attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

NeuertheleÅ¿Å¿e, we may boldly Å¿ay, that the method which wee propoÅ¿e, is not to be diÅ¿commended, becauÅ¿e we know by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that the practiÅ¿e therof, hath done very much good. For hauing preached Å¿ome Å¿mall time in 11. or 12. churches, in many of which, Å¿ome learned men were preÅ¿ent, which were greatly edified, &amp; principally in thoÅ¿e chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches which were in three or foure vniuerÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in which were many doctors, and a great number of Å¿tudents in diuinitie, verie well learned, who with many others, perceiuing how profitable it was, deÅ¿ired to haue it, and to bee made acquainted with the practiÅ¿e: Å¿ome haue craued it at our hands, and others
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:9089:97"/> haue very importunately intreated vs to Å¿ette it foorth in Print. And Å¿eeing that our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿e is to prepare to the MiniÅ¿trie, thoÅ¿e which are deÅ¿irous of this treatiÅ¿e, (and that it is neceÅ¿Å¿arie aboue all things, to bee well furniÅ¿hed to preach, which is the principall parte of this charge) by this occaÅ¿ion, wee haue obeyed vnto theyr lawfull requeÅ¿ts, more by conÅ¿traint then willingly, prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ting before God, and in our owne conÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that in this, we haue no other regard, then of the glorie of God, and the edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church: as wee doo aÅ¿Å¿ure our Å¿elues by the iÅ¿Å¿ue of this our enterpriÅ¿e, that the one and the other,<note place="margin">The prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher muÅ¿t not haue a vaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elfe.</note> Å¿hall bee greatly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered. And this we doo cheefely Å¿et down, that euerie one may Å¿ee that wee are not Å¿in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular in our owne opinion, which we haue placed afterwarde, for a long time, knowing wel, <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  </hi> there is nothing that Å¿o torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>teth the mind of the ambitious man, nothing which is more hard to keepe, nothing which more hindreth the way to vertue, and in Å¿umme, nothing is more peÅ¿tifferous and contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in any man, then this is, and eÅ¿pecially in him that deÅ¿ireth our charge. And I will adde this alÅ¿o to the reaÅ¿ons before alleaged, for what cauÅ¿e wee haue written this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod: that is, hauing layde the foundation thereof, vppon the Sermons of many great
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:9089:97"/> preachers, whom we haue heard in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, being very diligent in hearing them, and after meditating vppon their Sermons, haue broght the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> into writing (by which we greatly exerciÅ¿ed our memory) <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  </hi> I Å¿ay, many Å¿tudents were pricked forward by this our recitall, to hearke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> more attentiuely vnto the preaching &amp; leÅ¿Å¿ons, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> they did ordinarily before, and tooke great paines to remember them, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿ing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>Å¿elues, that they profited more by this means in one yeare: eÅ¿pecially hearing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies learned men, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> they had done before in Å¿ixe yeares by their priuate Å¿tudies. And conÅ¿idering <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  </hi> it is a Å¿hameful thing, &amp; full of reproch, that thoÅ¿e that haue Å¿o long frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the vniuerÅ¿ities &amp; places of Å¿tudy, Å¿hould Å¿o negligently Å¿uffer Å¿uch opportunities to paÅ¿Å¿e ouer, which afterward they could by no meanes recouer, &amp; that they would hereafter be more diligent, if it Å¿huld pleaÅ¿e God to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> the meanes to enioy <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi> like bleÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ings: and as for thoÅ¿e that haue not as yet bin at thoÅ¿e Å¿chooles, when they Å¿huld be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thither, they do aduiÅ¿e them diligently to regard this way of profiting, which is thoght moÅ¿t conuenient. Before wee come to Å¿ette downe our method, wee giue counÅ¿aile, that to follow and obÅ¿erue the Å¿ame profitably, it is neceÅ¿Å¿arie that wee Å¿hould bee furniÅ¿hed with thoÅ¿e parts which are requiÅ¿ite and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for the Å¿ame: that is, with knowledge
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:9089:98"/> and learning, in great quantitie and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. For otherwiÅ¿e we Å¿hal looÅ¿e our labor, and Å¿hall not attaine vnto it, no more then a man can build without matter: &amp; in truth, he doth fowly deceiue himÅ¿elf, that indeuoureth to imitate one that is Å¿ingular, if hee bee not endued with thoÅ¿e gifts, by which the other excelleth. Wherefore euerie one muÅ¿t fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the counÅ¿aile of <hi>Horace. Euerie one muÅ¿t looke what his Å¿houlders can beare, and what they cannot beare:</hi> that is, what abilitie and force is in vs, and according to the Å¿ame, to diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿e of our Å¿elues the beÅ¿t way that poÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly wee may. NeuertheleÅ¿Å¿e, wee may aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ure our Å¿elues, that whoÅ¿oeuer Å¿hall but in Å¿ome meaÅ¿ure, exerciÅ¿e himÅ¿elfe in the Å¿crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,<note place="margin">In prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the word of God, euery one muÅ¿t do as he is able.</note> hee may procure Å¿ufficient know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to Å¿erue his turne, if will he take paine, becauÅ¿e that is not inwrapped with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny difficulties nor Å¿ubtilties, neyther doth conÅ¿iÅ¿t of many hard precepts to obÅ¿erue, but it hath many eaÅ¿ie poyntes, as all they that vÅ¿e to reade them, may finde out by experience.<note place="margin">A profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ie method of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿iÅ¿teth in Å¿ixe points.</note> Howe profitable it is, wee will Å¿ay nothing: but we will leaue it to the iudgement of others.</p>
               <p>FirÅ¿t of al, we muÅ¿t wel conÅ¿ider &amp; meditate vpon <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi> text which we purpoÅ¿e to expound, to the end, that by a dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t &amp; deep meditation, we may haue a perfect vnderÅ¿tanding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:9089:98"/> and by the eye of our iudgement we may perceiue all the doctrine which maye fitly be gathered out of the Å¿ame, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the end.</p>
               <p>For the Å¿econd point, we muÅ¿t draw out the beginning, from the matter of the text it Å¿elfe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it muÅ¿t be diuided into partes, that is, Å¿uch notes muÅ¿t bee taken out of the text, which doth naturally ariÅ¿e out thereof: Å¿ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time two, Å¿ometime three, or fower, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the matter which we handle.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, we muÅ¿t expound in order euery doctrine, the which the Preacher muÅ¿t enrich with diuers amplifications, neither too long, nor too Å¿hort, but as profitably and fitly as he can, with Å¿imilitudes.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, he muÅ¿t vÅ¿e examples, Å¿ometime more, Å¿ometime leÅ¿Å¿e, as the Preacher Å¿hall iudge moÅ¿t expedient: Å¿ometimes alÅ¿o, it Å¿hall not be from the matter to vÅ¿e inductions, the better to mooue the hearers.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, to make the concluÅ¿ion, it is beÅ¿t to make a Å¿hort abridgement and Å¿ummarie, of that which he hath handled.<note place="margin">It is impoÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ible to vÅ¿e a method of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching to Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiÅ¿fie all the hearers</note>
               </p>
               <p>But becauÅ¿e as <hi>Gregorie Nazianzine</hi> Å¿aith, that in a multitude compounded and ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of all Å¿orts of men of all ages, of diuers hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors and complexions, it is hard to inuent a method of Preaching, which Å¿hould be Å¿o ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:9089:99"/> to all, that euery one Å¿hould be Å¿atiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and content: and beÅ¿ides he addeth, that as it is hard to tune all the Å¿trings of a Lute, or Sitterne, when one is but touched, Å¿o euery man may thinke, that this methode cannot pleaÅ¿e all, as in truth wee haue not Å¿ette it downe to that effect, but to leaue it to euery mans iudgement. Wherefore wee will expounde more at large, all that which we haue briefly Å¿aid. FirÅ¿t of all, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we Å¿ay, that we ought o haue a good vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tanding of the text, we might alledge infinit reaÅ¿ons wherfore <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  </hi> is neceÅ¿Å¿arie: but becauÅ¿e euery one maye conceiue many which wee cannot recite, therfore we leaue them to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mans conÅ¿ideration: Å¿aying onely in one word, that if any one Å¿hall be Å¿o vnwiÅ¿e and raÅ¿h, to take vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> him to expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>d a text which he doth not well vnderÅ¿tand, he muÅ¿t needes fall into an infinit company of abÅ¿urdities, and inconueniences.</p>
               <p>Secondly, where as we Å¿ay, that the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning muÅ¿t bee drawne from the text it Å¿elfe, which we well vnderÅ¿tand, that muÅ¿t be done as well for the eaÅ¿e of the preacher, as for him that heareth. Concerning the caÅ¿e of the Preacher, it is great in many reÅ¿pects, if hee knoweth and can doo it aptly: but if hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conueniently doo it, it Å¿hall not bee leÅ¿Å¿e hard vnto him, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> vnto them which are
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:9089:99"/> accuÅ¿tomed to draw it where they can: where Å¿ome begin Å¿ometimes with a place of Å¿crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as it Å¿eemeth moÅ¿t fit for their matter, others by a rep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>tition, Å¿ometimes tedious and vnprofitable, of thoÅ¿e things which they haue Å¿poken before. Others which reade Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries, begin with that which they finde there: wherby it may come to paÅ¿Å¿e, &amp; often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it doth, that many truÅ¿ting altogither to them, many times they teach thoÅ¿e things, which they doo not vnderÅ¿tand themÅ¿elues: wherof ariÅ¿eth many inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ueniences, eÅ¿pecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly theÅ¿e two: that is, they are hardly to bee vnderÅ¿tood of theyr hearers: and the other is, that in regarde they haue committed thoÅ¿e things to memorie, which they vnderÅ¿tand not, they doo quicklie forget them againe. There is alÅ¿o a third euill: that thoÅ¿e that are accuÅ¿tomed to learne without booke, not onely the beginning of theyr Å¿ermon, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿o the moÅ¿t part of the reÅ¿t, they Å¿hall verye hardly afterward make them themÅ¿elues, and with great difficultie become good peachers. Briefly, the beginning is Å¿o hard a thing, that it is Å¿aide in a common Prouerbe, that he that hath well begunne any worke, hath halfe brought it to paÅ¿Å¿e. This is Å¿poken of any worke whatÅ¿oeuer, but by a better reaÅ¿on wee may Å¿aye Å¿o of our Preaching: For in truth, euery one knoweth by experience, that
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:9089:100"/> thoÅ¿e that haue the dexteritie of beginning wel, afterwards without much difficultie, they may proceede: As it is eaÅ¿ie to builde a houÅ¿e when the foundation is well laid. He then that can keepe our method, may auoide all theÅ¿e inconueniences. For firÅ¿t drawing his beginning from his text, which he well vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derÅ¿tandeth, he Å¿hall hardly Å¿peake any thing, which Å¿hall not be vnderÅ¿tood.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if he hath meditated, or deuiÅ¿ed any thing, as he muÅ¿t continually do, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to vnderÅ¿tand that which hee would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, by this meanes I Å¿ay, he Å¿hal remember all, as naturally we keepe better thoÅ¿e things which we deuiÅ¿e, then thoÅ¿e which we read, or learne of others.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, hee Å¿hall more plainly bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tood of the hearers, and conÅ¿equently, hee Å¿hall Preache with much more edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, for the eaÅ¿e of the preacher, it Å¿hall be great in two reÅ¿pects. FirÅ¿t, in that he makes the beginning himÅ¿elfe, the which he draweth from the matter, which he doth very well vnderÅ¿tand: he cannot be Å¿o obÅ¿cure to his hearers, as if he drew it out of the booke of other men, or rehearÅ¿ing their Å¿ermons al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togither (as many doo) for although euery one may haue a priuate Å¿kill of himÅ¿elfe, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> Å¿ome naturall inclination, Å¿o euery one accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:9089:100"/> to the conceit, may lay the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Å¿ermons, and by the Å¿ame reaÅ¿on, others which will recite other mens workes, not hauing the Å¿ame Å¿pirite, they cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearÅ¿e them with Å¿uch vnderÅ¿tanding and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification, as the authors thereof. Secondly, there is no doubt, but that the hearer doth vnderÅ¿tand much better, that which the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher vnderÅ¿tandeth himÅ¿elf when he entreth into his matter. And verily this is a thing which the preacher muÅ¿t diligently obÅ¿erue, that in the beginning, hee Å¿peaketh nothing but firme and Å¿ound things, becauÅ¿e that the hearer hearing thoÅ¿e things in his enteraunce to his diÅ¿courÅ¿e, maye bee the more attentiue to heare the other partes, that followe.<note place="margin">The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Å¿ermon, muÅ¿t be Å¿ounde matter.</note> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiÅ¿e, if the Preacher beginneth with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of things going before, or elÅ¿e doo Å¿pend more time in thoÅ¿e things which are not material, the hearers which haue good eares, hearing that in the beginning, &amp; finding no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing woorthie the marking, they become colde and wearie to heare the reÅ¿t of the Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. It is true, that neceÅ¿Å¿itie vrging a man, he may well vÅ¿e Å¿ometime a repetition in the beginning of his Å¿ermon, and Å¿ometime in the middeÅ¿t: but that which may be done of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿itie, muÅ¿t not be done of cuÅ¿tome.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, concerning the diuiÅ¿ion of the text, gathering thoÅ¿e doctrines which are
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:9089:101"/> compriÅ¿ed therein, wee muÅ¿t note, that if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny will deÅ¿cribe the beautie of Å¿ome vertue, or the filthineÅ¿Å¿e of a vice, or in Å¿umme, the great profite of Å¿ome leÅ¿Å¿ons: it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie good to produce many reaÅ¿ons, and to lette the feebleÅ¿t firÅ¿t, and then thoÅ¿e that are more forcible: and conÅ¿equently, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And the reaÅ¿on is, in placing the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keÅ¿t firÅ¿t, and then the Å¿trongeÅ¿t, becauÅ¿e that the hearer, if he be not moued with one reaÅ¿on, two or three of more force beeing added, he may be moued to put that in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiÅ¿e, whereunto hee is Å¿tirred vppe. But herein he muÅ¿t take heed of two extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that Å¿etting downe many reaÅ¿ons, that they bee not Å¿trange from the text,<note place="margin">Two extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities to be auoyded in the expoÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the text.</note> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e it were better for him to content him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elfe with one or two, which may bee fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gathered out of the text, then to alleadge many which are farre feched: the other extremitie is, that beeing deÅ¿irous to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloÅ¿e himÅ¿elfe altogether within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paÅ¿Å¿e of his text, that hee will not go out: it commeth to paÅ¿Å¿e, that hee dooth rather paraphraÅ¿e then expounde. This kinde of interpretation is Å¿eemely, and conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, for him that teacheth in the Å¿choole, for the benefitte of them that doo Å¿tudie the grounds of diuinitie, who afterwarde beeing well grounded, may interpret th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:9089:101"/> Å¿cripture in a more ample and popular manner: it Å¿hall Å¿uffice vnto them to Å¿hewe the true Å¿enÅ¿e of the arguments of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the force and vertue of the words which doo occurre in the languages, the which that Å¿cripture contayneth, but the preacher muÅ¿t auoyde this extremitie for two reaÅ¿ons. The firÅ¿t is, that hauing a large text, wee cannot expounde the depth of the Å¿enÅ¿e thereof, nor enter into the bowelles of the Å¿ame, and by that meanes depriue our Å¿elues of many notable and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent doctrines and comforts, which are buried therein. The other is, that it may make the preacher idle, for onely to runne ouer a large text, which hee hath read, hee Å¿hall not neede to labour in drawing out all the doctrines and inÅ¿tructions, which hee might eaÅ¿ily gather, becauÅ¿e that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee Å¿hall haue Å¿hewed the meaning of his text, the greateÅ¿t parte of the time will bee Å¿pent, and more then is limited for an ordinarie Sermon.</p>
               <p>The greatneÅ¿Å¿e or the Å¿malneÅ¿Å¿e of the profite of the one or the other, plainely dooth appeare in this, that many hearers which are very wel read in the Å¿criptures, and who vnderÅ¿tand the Å¿enÅ¿e thereof, can Å¿ay as much as they that thus paraphraÅ¿tically run ouer a text, but when the hearers which are
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:9089:102"/> Å¿omething grounded and conuerÅ¿aunt in the Scripture, do heare the preacher Å¿peak many profitable things, expounding a place excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, and plentifully, &amp; that they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>Å¿elues cannot attaine vnto this kind of expounding the worde of God,<note place="margin">The prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher muÅ¿t expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>d his text copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouÅ¿ly.</note> this may incredibly moue them, and make them verie diligent in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to heare, and attentiue at Sermons, and in Å¿um, do bring great ioy and good, both to the Preachers, and hearers. Wherefore let vs conclude, that the Preacher ought moÅ¿t to giue himÅ¿elfe to this maner of expounding the Scripture copiouÅ¿ly: for he that will bee too Å¿uccinct, he Å¿hall not Å¿o much edifie. And further, it is much better to alledge many things which are of great vÅ¿e, although they may Å¿eeme to Å¿ome Å¿omewhat Å¿trange fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> the text, then to bee too Å¿crupulous in tying our Å¿elues too much to our text, and not to edifie. NeuertheleÅ¿Å¿e, we Å¿ay, that if our Method be well obÅ¿erued, that one can hardly go out of his text, becauÅ¿e that taking his beginning from the midÅ¿t of the text, which hee well vnderÅ¿tandeth, it muÅ¿t needs be, that this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning muÅ¿t be as a ParaphraÅ¿e, and a Å¿um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marie of the whole text: afterward, the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plification is a more plentifull declaration Å¿et downe in order, of al that which was Å¿poken in the beginning in a fewe words.</p>
               <p>This beginning may be compared vnto the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:9089:102"/> roundneÅ¿Å¿e of a circle, and the expoÅ¿ition by his parts: that is, a Å¿taying within the circle, &amp; Å¿o to be incloÅ¿ed, that he cannot go out: or if one would Å¿peak more plainly, the beginning is like <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi> Å¿elling of a marchants ware by whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ale, and the expoÅ¿ition by parts, is like the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailing thereof. In the fourth place, hauing Å¿et downe, that we muÅ¿t vÅ¿e Å¿imilitudes, we Å¿ay, that it is neceÅ¿Å¿arie for infinite reaÅ¿ons which would be long to recite: but we mean, that Å¿eeing that Å¿imilitudes be of maruailous vÅ¿e, prouided alwayes that they be of weight, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

To bee breefe, for the prayÅ¿e of a Å¿imilitude, there is nothing of more force then the example of <hi>Salomon,</hi> who beeing Å¿o great a man, that beÅ¿ides IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:9089:103"/> there was none like vnto him: hee would not adorne his Oracles, but with the title of Prouerbes. Afterwarde hee addeth a poynt to bee marked: Take away (Å¿ayth he) a Metaphor and a Å¿imilitude from Orators, all things bee little and of no value. Take away the Prouerbes and Parables from the writings of the Prophets and Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liÅ¿ts, and thou Å¿halt take away the moÅ¿t part of the grace of the Å¿criptures. To all theÅ¿e commodities, wee may ioyne alÅ¿o this, which is of great conÅ¿equence, that is, when one expoundeth an hard place, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that maketh it Å¿ooner to bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tood then a Å¿imilitude:<note place="margin">A Profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vÅ¿e of a Å¿imilitude.</note> for although of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes many reaÅ¿ons bee brought, and thoÅ¿e which bee of force, neuertheleÅ¿Å¿e, experience Å¿heweth, that by them one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Å¿o eaÅ¿ily conceiue many difficulties: but if one vÅ¿eth a familiar Å¿imilitude, and eaÅ¿ie to bee vnderÅ¿tood, it commeth to paÅ¿Å¿e, that hard things are without labour vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tood: and all thoÅ¿e reaÅ¿ons which were alleadged before, to make the matter playne, are made cleare and manifeÅ¿t by Å¿imilitudes.

<pb n="205" facs="tcp:9089:106"/> of our brethren, and our neighbours, as wee are bound by the dutie of charitie. But now alas: this litle member is moÅ¿t daungerous: by that we Å¿peake euill of our brethren, backe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite them by enuying their vertue, Å¿hewing our contempt of thoÅ¿e gifts, and graces which they haue receiued, by that we doo diminiÅ¿h as much as in vs lieth, their eÅ¿timation, and credit, and make all men know, that we haue our heart full of wickedneÅ¿Å¿e, and Å¿iniÅ¿ter af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, towardes them: but that which is more, it is no leÅ¿Å¿e diÅ¿ordered towardes God, for to deÅ¿pite him, as much as men may: for by this, we diÅ¿honor him, Å¿peake euill of him, by this wicked miÅ¿creants do belch out infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit outrages, &amp; execrable blaÅ¿phemies againÅ¿t his Å¿acred maieÅ¿tie, which they intollerably teare in Å¿under: briefly, by this they commit a multitude of innumerable Å¿innes.

Secondly, that being
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:9089:107"/> all Å¿ubiect heereunto, we muÅ¿t take heede of flattering of our Å¿elues, but rather with might and maine auoyde the Å¿ame, and the better to flye from it,<note place="margin">The Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plification of the firÅ¿t part.</note> to conÅ¿ider the horrible miÅ¿chiefs which commeth from it.

               <p>This is the reaÅ¿on that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> Å¿ayth, liuely pointing out the nature of man,<note place="margin">Rom. 3</note> and Å¿hewing how it is corrupt in it Å¿elfe, <hi>There is none righteous, no not one. There is none that vnderÅ¿tandeth: there is none that Å¿eeketh God. They haue all gone out of the way, they haue beene made altogither vnprofitable: there is none that doth good, no not one. Their throat is an open Å¿epulchre, they haue vÅ¿ed their tongues to deceit: the poyÅ¿on of AÅ¿pes is vnder their lippes: whoÅ¿e mouth is full of curÅ¿ing and bitterneÅ¿Å¿e, &amp;c.</hi> By which place he Å¿heweth, that all vniuerÅ¿al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, are euill Å¿peakers, and Å¿landerers, fowlie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buÅ¿ing our tongue: and although he Å¿peaketh principally of <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

               <p>And for this cauÅ¿e, <hi>Dauid</hi> which by the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿timony of the Å¿cripture, was a man after Gods heart, Å¿triuing againÅ¿t this vice: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though hee were one of the moÅ¿t patienteÅ¿t that euer were, in bearing iniuries done vnto him, yet he praieth earneÅ¿tly vnto God in this manner.</p>

               <p>According to this, mention is made in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine place of a memorable hyÅ¿tory of a great PerÅ¿onage, who hauing oftentimes imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that there is nothing Å¿o harde as to bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle the tongue, hee Å¿aith, that hee hath long co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>Å¿idered &amp; meditated vppon the thirtie and ninth. <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> of <hi>Dauid,</hi> where it is Å¿aid, I <hi>thought I will take brede to my waies, that I Å¿inne not with my tongue:</hi>

And indeed, we muÅ¿t not thinke that <hi>Dauid</hi> practiÅ¿ed that which he Å¿aith in this place, but he would giue vs to vnderÅ¿tand, that he labored to containe himÅ¿elf as much as he could, that although he liued amongÅ¿t the outrages of the wicked, yet neuertheleÅ¿Å¿e, hee endured them patiently, knowing well, that thoÅ¿e things came not to paÅ¿Å¿e at aduenture, but by the prouidence of God, who would after this manner exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciÅ¿e him, and in truth, he that will take theÅ¿e words Å¿o Å¿tricktly, he Å¿hall marueilouÅ¿ly bee deceiued: I meane, that woulde thinke neuer any angry, or furious word eÅ¿caped <hi>Dauid</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t the wicked: Å¿o that hee that can finde a man that doth not offend in his tongue, hee Å¿hall bee the moÅ¿t perfect among the liuing.

So in like manner when it is heere Å¿ayde, <hi>This is my bodie, this is my bloud,</hi> theÅ¿e wordes cannot any way beare this Å¿ignification, that wee Å¿hould vnderÅ¿tande by them a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all conuerÅ¿ion into the bodie and bloud of ChriÅ¿t.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, theÅ¿e wordes of tranÅ¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tantiation, doo bring with them three abÅ¿urdityes. The firÅ¿t is, that if the bread and wine Å¿houlde bee turned into the body and bloud of IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, there Å¿hould bee no Å¿igne in the Supper, and Å¿o there Å¿hould bee no Å¿acrament, which cannot bee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a viÅ¿ible Å¿igne. The Å¿econde is, that the bloud of IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t Å¿houlde bee Å¿eparated from his bodie, which is alÅ¿o abÅ¿urde and impoÅ¿Å¿ible. The thirde, that IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t Å¿houlde haue a bodie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, and by conÅ¿equent, hee Å¿houlde not bee true man, nor truely aÅ¿cended into heauen, which Å¿houlde ouerthrowe the principall Articles of our fayth. And tis to no purpoÅ¿e to obiect heere, that hee hath a gloryfied body, by which hee may bee at one time in diuers places toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for this replie is vayne, becauÅ¿e hee hadde no Å¿uch bodie, when as hee inÅ¿tituted the Supper: and beÅ¿ides, his
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:9089:112"/> glorification, did not any way diminiÅ¿h the nature of a true bodie, but onely did make him infinite, as an auncient Doctor hath verie well Å¿ayde. And wherefore it is Å¿ayde in the Acts of the ApoÅ¿tles, <hi>That the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens Å¿hould containe him vntill the daie of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when hee Å¿hall viÅ¿iblie deÅ¿cende, as he was Å¿eene to aÅ¿cende.</hi> The fourth is, that infidels and hypocrites comming to the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, Å¿houlde truely participate the bodie and bloud of ChriÅ¿t, and Å¿o it muÅ¿t needes follow, that GOD and the diuell Å¿hould bee lodged togither. And beÅ¿ides theÅ¿e abÅ¿urdities, which doo beate downe tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ubÅ¿tantiation, experience it Å¿elfe is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t it. Wee may perceiue the bread and wine to conÅ¿ume away, beeing long time kept, for this dooth Å¿hewe moÅ¿t plainely, that the Å¿ubÅ¿tance of them is not chaunged. As alÅ¿o theÅ¿e wordes beeing well vnderÅ¿tood, doo ouerthrowe tranÅ¿ubÅ¿tantiation, Å¿o they doo likewiÅ¿e confute theyr CouÅ¿in germane, which is ConÅ¿ubÅ¿tantiation: that is, thoÅ¿e which doo affirme, that the body of IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t beeing euerie where, it muÅ¿t needes bee in the Breade of the Lordes Supper, that it is eyther aboue or belowe, or at one Å¿ide, or within, as his bloud is in the VVine. The wordes of IeÅ¿us
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:9089:112"/> ChriÅ¿t, cannot likewiÅ¿e beare this Å¿ence. For if they will Å¿o vnderÅ¿tand them, IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t muÅ¿t haue Å¿aid, <hi>My bodie Å¿hall bee with this bread, and my bloud with this wine.</hi> Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, this Å¿houlde bee to fall to a fleÅ¿hlye and carnall eating, which cauÅ¿e vs to fall into the three laÅ¿t abÅ¿urdities of tranÅ¿ubÅ¿tantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>When IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t Å¿aith to the Caper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naites, who did imagine a carnall eating (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e hee had Å¿aid, <hi>That vnleÅ¿Å¿e one eate his FleÅ¿h, and drinke his bloud, that he cannot haue eternall life.</hi>) He Å¿aide vnto them in the VerÅ¿e, three Å¿core and three, expounding himÅ¿elfe: <hi>It is the Å¿pirit that quickneth, the fleÅ¿h profiteth nothing: the wordes that I Å¿peake vn-you, are Å¿pirit and life.</hi> Is not this place cleare inough? to Å¿hew, that heÅ¿e woordes muÅ¿t be vnderÅ¿toode, Å¿piritually and not carnallye? And although that there hee Å¿peaketh not of a Å¿acramentall eating, but of that which is made by the woorde of GOD, which is receiued by faith, notwithÅ¿tanding it maye verye well imparte thus much, becauÅ¿e it is the Å¿ame kinde of eating in Å¿ubÅ¿taunce, Å¿o that whatÅ¿oeuer is Å¿poken of the one, doth belong alÅ¿o to the other: and Å¿eeing that queÅ¿tion is made of the nouriÅ¿hment of the Å¿oule which is Å¿pirituall, and that the foode thereof is
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:9089:113"/> Å¿pirituall, it muÅ¿t neceÅ¿Å¿arily follow, that the eating muÅ¿t be alÅ¿o Å¿pirituall, and not groÅ¿Å¿e, and carnall. And to be Å¿o, it cannot other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e be, but that the bread and wine Å¿houlde be nothing elÅ¿e but Å¿ignes onely of the body, and bloud of ChriÅ¿t: and that they do alwaies remaine bread and wine, after the wordes of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>Å¿ecration, and after the partaking thereof. As it is eaÅ¿ie by Saint <hi>Paule,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.</note> where hee Å¿aith: <hi>The cuppe of bleÅ¿Å¿ing which we bleÅ¿Å¿e, is it not the communion of the bloud of ChriÅ¿t? The bread which we breake, is it not the communion of the body of ChriÅ¿t?</hi> It is not Å¿aid, that the cup of bleÅ¿Å¿ing which one bleÅ¿Å¿eth, is the bloud of ChriÅ¿t really, &amp; <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  </hi> the bread which we break, is the proper and Å¿ubÅ¿tantiall body of ChriÅ¿t: but that it is the communion of the one, and of the other, by the which words he declareth plainly, that the bread and the wine doth alwaies remaine bread and wine, but they are certaine and infallible pledges, of that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, which we haue in <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi> body of ChriÅ¿t. See alÅ¿o, <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  </hi> the bread, &amp; the wine, are nothing but Å¿ignes of the body, and of the bloud of ChriÅ¿t: yet neuertheleÅ¿Å¿e we do participate of the Å¿ame, as trulie, as if we Å¿huld eat his fleÅ¿h, and drinke his bloud, after a carnall manner. Let vs adde, that this interpretation (which is the Å¿econd point we haue to handle) cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿eth no inconuenience, and that by the Å¿ame,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:9089:113"/> thoÅ¿e foure abÅ¿urdities which are recited be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, are auoided: for by the Å¿ame, the Å¿ignes remaine in their owne nature, the bloode of IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, is not Å¿eparated from his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, his humainitie is not diminiÅ¿hed, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the truth of his aÅ¿cenÅ¿ion, and Å¿itting at the right hand of his Father.</p>
               <p>And further,<note place="margin">The Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifying of the Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part.</note> wicked men Å¿hall not partake of the body of ChriÅ¿t, and of his blood. But what will bee obiected, if this bee the true meaning of ChriÅ¿t? how is it declared by more manifeÅ¿t words, and leÅ¿Å¿e doubtfull? One anÅ¿wereth, that this promiÅ¿e cannot be made by a more briefe kinde of Å¿peeche, and more Å¿ignificant. For if hee had Å¿aide, <hi>This is the pledge, and the Å¿igne of my body,</hi> there Å¿huld not haue been a promiÅ¿e as there is, vnleÅ¿Å¿e he had vÅ¿ed more words, as if hee Å¿houlde haue Å¿aide: I aÅ¿Å¿ure you, that this bread, and this Wine, doth Å¿o repreÅ¿ent vnto you my body, and my bloud, that as often as you do partake of theÅ¿e viÅ¿ible things, you Å¿hall trulie communicate of that which is Å¿ignified vnto you. And Å¿o it muÅ¿t needes haue come to paÅ¿Å¿e, that ChriÅ¿t muÅ¿t haue doone, as flatterers that goe about to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿wade any man, vÅ¿e many woordes, and arguments, but there is no force manye times in theyr Å¿peeche, as commonly it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth to thoÅ¿e that being deÅ¿irous to make
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:9089:114"/> others, beleeue Å¿omething, they haue copie of words, but little matter. ContrariwiÅ¿e, Å¿eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and graue things, doo require ordinarily fewe words, but very Å¿ignificant, and full of force, and maieÅ¿tie: we Å¿ee for the moÅ¿t part, that Kings and Princes Å¿peaking of any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of importaunce to them that are about them, oftentimes they vÅ¿e but one woorde, which they do print in their minde, as though it were Å¿ome oracle from heauen, they doo ponder, and imagine to finde out that which he would Å¿ay, that if they vÅ¿ed many wordes, they would not Å¿o eaÅ¿ily be carried away, and they which hearde them, would not be Å¿o at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiue to conÅ¿ider them. Namely, this is perceiued in great men, when as they make promiÅ¿es to their familiars, for beeing Å¿o made in fewe wordes, they haue more grace and waight. So IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t in this place Å¿peaking to his DiÅ¿ciples, to communicate with them his body, and his bloud, (which was a thing of great importance) he Å¿pake in fewe words. <hi>This is my body and my bloud,</hi> that is to Å¿ay, which Å¿ignifieth my body, and my bloud. And this was alÅ¿o for the benifit of the DiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples: for they hauing vnderÅ¿toode theÅ¿e words of their MaiÅ¿ter, they might thinke themÅ¿elues what their maiÅ¿ter meant, when he Å¿aid: <hi>This is my body.</hi> For when he Å¿pake theÅ¿e words vnto them, they were a long time
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:9089:114"/> at the table, eating and drinking with him, &amp; he neuer Å¿pake any Å¿uch thing: Å¿o that they might co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>clude with themÅ¿elues, that by theÅ¿e words, he would Å¿ignifie Å¿ome great matter: Å¿o that this thing beeing well conÅ¿idered, his DiÅ¿ciples might bee the more wakened by theÅ¿e fewe wordes full of waight and maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tie, diligently to ponder them, as if hee had vÅ¿ed many wordes. Although already this matter is Å¿ufficiently manifeÅ¿ted, yet wee will make it more euident by theÅ¿e reaÅ¿ons fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. FirÅ¿t that Å¿pirit of God, hath vÅ¿ed the like Å¿peeche as he hath done heere in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿e of all the Å¿acraments, of the old teÅ¿tame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t, that is, in giuing the name of the thing Å¿igni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and inuiÅ¿ible, vnto the exteriour Å¿igne. As we reade in <hi>GeneÅ¿is,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 17</note> that God beeing wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to aÅ¿Å¿ure <hi>Abraham</hi> &amp; his poÅ¿teritie, that CircumciÅ¿ion was a certaine Å¿igne vnto them, that he had receiued them into his couenant, hee calleth CircumciÅ¿ion his couenant,<note place="margin">Exod. 12.</note> in fewe words. The like Å¿aith <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> of the Sacrament of the PaÅ¿chall Lambe, calling it the Lords paÅ¿Å¿eouer: for to Å¿ignifie vnto the Iewes, that they Å¿hould be aÅ¿Å¿ured of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall fauour of God, hauing giuen them a taÅ¿te of his incomprehenÅ¿ible bountie, when he Å¿ent his deÅ¿troying Angell, who Å¿lewe all the firÅ¿t borne, as well of men as of beaÅ¿tes, in all the houÅ¿es of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and paÅ¿Å¿ed ouer the
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:9089:115"/> children of <hi>IÅ¿rael,</hi> without dooing them any hurt, whereof that ceremony of the PaÅ¿chall Lambe, was to them a Å¿acrament. To theÅ¿e kindes of Å¿peaking, we may ioyne that which S. <hi>Paul</hi> vÅ¿eth,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 10</note> where he Å¿aith: <hi>That our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers haue eat the Å¿ame meat, and drunk the Å¿ame drinke in the wilderneÅ¿Å¿e, which we haue done, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e that the rocke out of which iÅ¿Å¿ued the water which they dranke, was ChriÅ¿t:</hi> for this manner of Å¿peeche is altogither like this. But lette vs diligently obÅ¿erue, that this maner of Å¿pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,) <hi>This is my body,</hi> wherof here queÅ¿tion is made: is likewiÅ¿e Å¿o vÅ¿ed in our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> tongue, as for example, If a king Å¿heweth fauour vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a male factor, giuing vnto him, the letters of his fauour, Å¿ealed with his owne Å¿eale, it is Å¿aid co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>monly to the malefactor, beholde thy pardon: &amp; yet neuertheleÅ¿Å¿e, thoÅ¿e letters which are giuen him, are not his pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, but a certain &amp; infallible Å¿igne of his pardon. So in this Å¿acrament we Å¿ee the like, for they are called Å¿eales of the word of God. As Saint <hi>Paule</hi> doth beare witneÅ¿Å¿e of CircumciÅ¿ion:<note place="margin">Rom. 4</note> which he calleth to the Romaines, <hi>The Å¿eale of the righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e of faith.</hi> It Å¿eemeth, that it was impoÅ¿Å¿ible to vÅ¿e any plainer kinde of Å¿peech to vnderÅ¿tand, ChriÅ¿ts meaning, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any conceit of carnal eating, and humain drinking, as though we were deuourers of men like thoÅ¿e kinde of people, called <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropophagi,</hi>
                  <pb n="239" facs="tcp:9089:115"/> and <hi>Cyclopes.</hi> But we may cauÅ¿e a greater light to Å¿hine to our Å¿elues, when we are certainly aÅ¿Å¿ured, that we do partake the body and bloud of ChriÅ¿t, by Å¿aith: which is the proper inÅ¿trument which God hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> vs, to eat his body, and drinke his bloud, that is, that we conÅ¿tantly beleeue, that we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate trulie with his body, and that our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ciences are thereof Å¿o well aÅ¿Å¿ured,<note place="margin">The meane how we doe partake the body, and blood of ChriÅ¿t in, the Å¿upper.</note> that wee neede not to doubt.

<pb n="272" facs="tcp:9089:132"/> Å¿peake before Kings and Princes, it is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of great difficultie. For great men are diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaÅ¿ed to heare themÅ¿elues cenÅ¿ured, and commonly they are incenÅ¿ed in Å¿uch Å¿ort, that thoÅ¿e that reprehend them, are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ger. To correct this feare, we muÅ¿t do that which the word of god commandeth vs: and herein follow the example of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. The teÅ¿timonies of the worde for this point, are almoÅ¿t infinit, where this is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, and euery one may read the Å¿ame: but wee will produce Å¿ome of the auncient fathers,<note place="margin">The prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher muÅ¿t not flatter whom he Å¿hould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue.</note> which are known to euery one, which ought to be of great importance to perÅ¿wade euery one to ouercome this difficultie.

Thirdly, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as

Hee Å¿ayth alÅ¿o in the Å¿ame place, ConÅ¿ider my brethren, what a condemnation you procure to your Å¿elues, when without labour ye take the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of labour: what a hainous crime is this, to take the price of Å¿inne, and in our preaching, to Å¿peake nothing againÅ¿t Å¿inne? AlÅ¿o hee Å¿ayth in one of his Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes vppon <hi>Ezechiel:</hi> We that are called PrieÅ¿tes, beÅ¿ides many Å¿innes which are proper vnto vs, wee doo adde vnto our Å¿elues other mens Å¿innes, when wee doo not reprooue them: that is to Å¿ay, Å¿o ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as die in theyr Å¿innes, wee are the cauÅ¿e of theyr deathes, if wee reprehende them not, as our dutie requireth.

This verily is a poynt to be noted, if we take the wages of men, then wee ought to bee diligent and watchfull to reprehende them, when occaÅ¿ion Å¿erueth, becauÅ¿e that may preuaile very much to amende them.</p>
               <p>The opinion of Å¿ome is, that if they

There is onely this difference, that the grace of God was more plentifully powred forth by them, then by vs: and therefore, we muÅ¿t ad, that as the grace of God was more amply declared by them, Å¿o alÅ¿o a greater honor was due vnto them: euen Å¿o now at this day hee muÅ¿t bee moÅ¿t honoured, vnto whome God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated moÅ¿t graces, otherwiÅ¿e hee that will not do it, muÅ¿t be reckoned vnthanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnto the goodneÅ¿Å¿e of God.

But alÅ¿o we muÅ¿t conÅ¿ider, that Å¿eeing that God will bee Å¿erued by our MiniÅ¿trie, as he was by that of the Prophets and ApoÅ¿tles, it pleaÅ¿eth him alÅ¿o that wee Å¿hould be accounted of, as they were, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the meaÅ¿ure of graces, which it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿eth him to diÅ¿tribute to euery one.

It might alÅ¿o be obiected, that we Å¿hould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite Å¿omething done by them, which were a matter of no great difficultie.

This was the Trumpet, the Å¿ounde whereof was blowne through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the borders of the earth: at this Å¿ounde the moÅ¿t mightie and valiant kings haue trembled in theyr thrones: to bee briefe, this Munke with a fewe of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, haue drawne the moÅ¿t and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teÅ¿t parte of ChriÅ¿tendome out of the clawes of AntichriÅ¿t, a thouÅ¿ande milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men, who were blinde from theyr birth, haue had theyr eyes opened by theyr MiniÅ¿trie, and afterward, hauing perceiued and knowne the wholÅ¿ome truth, haue conÅ¿tantly perÅ¿iÅ¿ted in the Å¿me, euen vntill death.</p>
               <p>This verily beeing weighed in an equall ballance, is as great a myracle as hath beene doone by the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tles: yea, and rather wee are to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that this is a miracle of miracles, inÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that this great miracle is doone with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a miracle. Then if theÅ¿e things bee Å¿o, (not to make any longer diÅ¿courÅ¿e of this matter) who is it that looking more narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vppon theÅ¿e maruailous and more then admirable exployts, which are doone by the PaÅ¿tors of our age, is not aÅ¿tonied, and euen rauiÅ¿hed with the vnÅ¿peakeable MaieÅ¿tie
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:9089:153"/> of their actions, and hath them in Å¿ingular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence, and loueth them not with all his heart and affection? who can Å¿ufficiently commend the excellencie of theyr charge? who can expreÅ¿Å¿e how profitable, and neceÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿arie, the adminiÅ¿tration therof is? what man is there that loueth godlineÅ¿Å¿e and true honour, which dooth not earneÅ¿tly deÅ¿ire to bee Å¿o much honoured, as to bee em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in this function. In what happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e may hee thinke himÅ¿elfe to bee, that is in Å¿ome meaÅ¿ure capable to Å¿erue God in this calling.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N truth now, beeing in the way liuely to exhort the youth to take vpon them this holy charge, from which they may be diÅ¿couraged by reaÅ¿on of the infinite difficulties which are preÅ¿ented be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, wee doo it the more willingly,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:9089:153"/> becauÅ¿e wee deÅ¿ire nothing more then the glorie of God, and the Å¿aluation of our Brethren, both which, cannot bee better furthered then by this charge. But alas, which way Å¿hall I beginne? The beautie, dignitie, and incomparable profite of the Å¿ame, ought to be as Å¿harpe Å¿purres, to Å¿tirre vppe euerie one. When one deÅ¿ireth that Å¿ome Å¿houlde applie themÅ¿elues vnto thoÅ¿e things, which doo appeare Å¿o good in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Å¿hew, to allure and draw men there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, it is verie neceÅ¿Å¿arie to vÅ¿e many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons and arguments, to bring them thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and to pricke them forward: but in things that be of themÅ¿elues maruailous, excellent, and verie profitable, euerie one ought to embrace them of his owne accord. There is no lightneÅ¿Å¿e Å¿o glorious, as that of the MiniÅ¿trie, there is no calling, to bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared thereunto, in dignitie and profite: wherof then commeth it to paÅ¿Å¿e, that many do Å¿o little regard it? <hi>Plato</hi> hath Å¿ayde that vertue is Å¿o fayre, that if her beautie could be diÅ¿cerned with theÅ¿e corporall eyes, it would prouoke great loue of itÅ¿elf: what difference is there between the beauty of the miniÅ¿trie,<note place="margin">A confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the obiection of the ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</note> and <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  </hi> of morall vertue? if one would propoÅ¿e vnto himÅ¿elf the litle reckoning &amp; account, which is ordinarily made of miniÅ¿ters, hee would deteÅ¿t the Å¿ame: we anÅ¿wer <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  </hi> this is the
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:9089:154"/> obiection of an ambitious man, and to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect this ambition, thou muÅ¿t Å¿et before thy eyes, that the honour which thou doÅ¿t deÅ¿ire and gape after, it is worldly and vaine. And if it bee Å¿o, thou wanteÅ¿t iudgement in deÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it, and in that thou Å¿heweÅ¿t the follie and vanitie of thy minde. Further, thou muÅ¿t conÅ¿ider, that the honour which thou dreameÅ¿t of, to be in Å¿ome other calling, is often times troubleÅ¿ome, greeuous, which is deare before it bee gotten, and hard to bee kept. He that will be a phiÅ¿itian, how many trauailes &amp; cares muÅ¿t he paÅ¿Å¿e through? how often muÅ¿t he watch in the night, before he can attaine his purpoÅ¿e, &amp; when he thinketh that he hath attained it, how muÅ¿t he toile &amp; labor to be knowne, &amp; to be had in eÅ¿timati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? when he is once knowne, &amp; Å¿ought after for his skill, is he then more quiet &amp; at reÅ¿t? muÅ¿t he not Å¿ometime riÅ¿e out of his bed to help his patient? he muÅ¿t make haÅ¿te, he muÅ¿t ride in poÅ¿t many times with the daunger of the loÅ¿Å¿e of his own health: what more? whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>meth to viÅ¿it his patient, what Å¿auours is he conÅ¿trained to Å¿mel? &amp; the better to know the qualitie of <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi> diÅ¿eaÅ¿e, &amp; the iÅ¿Å¿ue therof, he muÅ¿t Å¿omtime view the verie excrements of the Å¿ick man, and taÅ¿te them: what pleaÅ¿ure I pray you, or what delight ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> he take in that? doth the lawyer endure leÅ¿Å¿e trauels? doth he
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:9089:154"/> enioy his honors with more peace and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quilitie of the minde? how many times in the day, doth one or other come &amp; knock at his gate, and breake his head with Å¿olliciting his matter, which hee hath committed vnto his hand? Moreouer, thou muÅ¿t conÅ¿ider, that all theÅ¿e affayres for which they are Å¿o tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and continually vexed, they are about earthly things, and Å¿o conÅ¿equently, all the honor &amp; profit which they get by the Å¿ame, is tranÅ¿itory, and vaniÅ¿h away as the Å¿moake. To conclude, meditate thou vpon this, for thy comfort, that thou art honoured in the adminiÅ¿tration of thy miniÅ¿terie, of all thoÅ¿e that are wiÅ¿e, and feare God: and Å¿eeing that is the true honour, which commeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> good men, and not from Å¿enÅ¿ual men, we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that thou haÅ¿t more honor then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For in truth, the honour that is receiued from men well inÅ¿tructed, is to be preferred before that which is giuen of the ignorant. But of all things propound before thee, that thou art honoured of God. For the Å¿cripture Å¿peaking of the Preachers of the word, doth teach vs, that ChriÅ¿t hath Å¿aid: <hi>WhoÅ¿oeuer ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noreth you, honors me, &amp;c.</hi> In this world when we are honoured of Kings and Princes, and great Lords, we make more account of that honour, then of that which wee receiue from thoÅ¿e that be inferiors, becauÅ¿e that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:9089:155"/> that they are that honoureth vs, Å¿o ought their honour to be priÅ¿ed and valued. Seing then God doth Å¿o honour MiniÅ¿ters and theyr MiniÅ¿trie, that hee attributeth that honour vnto them, which is giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himÅ¿elfe: wherefore doÅ¿t thou that art a PaÅ¿tor, take care for the honour of men? And if thou doÅ¿t adde hereunto, thoÅ¿e ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable titles which are giuen vnto faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full PaÅ¿tors, thou wouldeÅ¿t make leÅ¿Å¿e ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the honour of the world, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿teeme more the incomparable honour of the miniÅ¿trie. But if any other Å¿hall obiect, that therefore he is diÅ¿couraged, becauÅ¿e that the MiniÅ¿ters for the moÅ¿t part are poore, needy, and in miÅ¿erie, we anÅ¿were that this is the obiection of a couetous man:<note place="margin">A confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the obiection of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous.</note> and to correct this vice of couetouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e, conÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der on the other Å¿ide, that they that haue more meanes to liue by, then other, yet they alÅ¿o bee poore: and further, that pouertie is no vice, but that it is as acceptable vnto God of it Å¿elfe, as riches, when as well the one as the other doo come from GOD, if they bee vÅ¿ed as they ought.</p>
               <p>Secondly, think with thy Å¿elf, that there is at this day, almoÅ¿t no men, which are addicted to any other Å¿tudy, as to any arte mechanick, who doo finde more eaÅ¿ily, honeÅ¿t conditions
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:9089:155"/> to liue, then thoÅ¿e that haue giuen them Å¿elues to the Å¿tudie of diuinitie, as wee haue Å¿eene within this Å¿euen or eight yeares, that many PhiÅ¿itians, Lawyers, Aduocates, Proc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, Notaries, many marchants, many great Lordes and gentlemen, beeing gone out of <hi>France,</hi> and other places, are conÅ¿trained to trauaile vp and downe in Å¿trange Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and haue Å¿uffered much want, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they haue beene skilfull in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿Å¿ion, and haue beene rich at home, but thoÅ¿e that haue Å¿tudied diuinitie, haue founde alwaies many commodities to Å¿wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the rigour of theyr exile. Thirdly, conÅ¿ider, that if they haue not Å¿uch goods, and richeÅ¿Å¿e, as many Marchaunts, Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, and other men of trades in this world, that God hath giuen vnto them a contented life, which is accompanied with godlineÅ¿Å¿e, and the feare of God.</p>
               <p>In the fourth place, thou muÅ¿t meditate, that GGD is the plentifull rewarder of all the MiniÅ¿ters of GOD, and thou muÅ¿t thinke vppon all thoÅ¿e excellent promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es of GOD, which hee maketh in his worde, to nouriÅ¿h all liuing creatures. For if hee feedeth the beaÅ¿tes of the fielde, he will much more nouriÅ¿h men, and if he nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿heth all men, much more the faithfull,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:9089:156"/> and principally thoÅ¿e whom he hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, for the teaching and leading of them. To make an ende of this point, Å¿ette before thine eyes, that if they abound not in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, and earthly goods: yet they are riche in the knowledge of the word of God, in the vnderÅ¿tanding, and reuealing of his Å¿ecrets, which are the true riches of the Å¿oule: and Å¿ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that thoÅ¿e be the true riches, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>Å¿ider that the more thou aboundeÅ¿t with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, the more thou art truly rich: for theÅ¿e riches wil bring vnto thee Å¿o much ioy and gladneÅ¿Å¿e, as the corporall and worldly goods, doo bring vnto them that poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿e them, griefe, and care, and Å¿o enioying theÅ¿e true and Å¿incere Å¿pirituall rithes, why doÅ¿t thou take Å¿uch thought for the riches of this world? If another doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,<note place="margin">A confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoÅ¿e that loue plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ure.</note> that his heart is pulled downe, becauÅ¿e that miniÅ¿ters are ordinarily Å¿orowfull, pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿iue, full of care and melancholy, I may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mande of him, why are they more then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men? TheÅ¿e bee vaine and imaginarie fanÅ¿ies, forged in the braine, of I knowe not what worldly men, for they are as ioyfull as other, and it is as lawfull for them as for any other. It is true, it is their dutie to be Å¿age, wiÅ¿e, prudent, modeÅ¿t, graue, and honeÅ¿t, but this doth not hinder them, but that they may vÅ¿e a moderate ioy, and agreeable to their vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: and on the contrary, this ioy doth
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:9089:156"/> bring more contentation, as it differeth from the reioycing of the prophane. <hi>Seneca</hi> Å¿ayth in a certaine place, that we muÅ¿t gouerne our Å¿elues in Å¿uch Å¿ort, that none may think vs too Å¿euere, and again, that none deÅ¿piÅ¿e vs, as thoÅ¿e that be vile &amp; contemptible, &amp; that we muÅ¿t more delight in profitable matters, then in things that be rediculous: &amp; he addeth, that one may mingle Å¿ometime amongÅ¿t graue &amp; Å¿erious matters, thoÅ¿e things that be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ant, but we muÅ¿t take heed that they bee Å¿o tempered, that they do not diÅ¿credit their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. If this bee Å¿o, who is he that thinketh the PaÅ¿tor worthie of reprehenÅ¿ion, if Å¿ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time vpon occaÅ¿ion he vÅ¿eth pleaÅ¿ant words, and full of delight (which are more the Å¿ignes of gentleman-like nature, then of any vice) Å¿eeing that it is proper and naturall to great and rare perÅ¿onages to haue (as it is Å¿ayd in the common prouerb) Å¿ome grace in theyr Å¿peech? But Å¿ome will obiect that they muÅ¿t of neceÅ¿Å¿itie abÅ¿taine from many plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ures, which are lawfull to others, which be in other callings. Lette vs demaunde of them againe what they bee, if one ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineth that they ought not to vÅ¿e the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall pleaÅ¿ures, which are, to drinke, to eate Å¿oberlie, and many Å¿uch like, which our outward Å¿enÅ¿es do enioy, he may bee anÅ¿we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that it is lawful for them to vÅ¿e them, as it
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:9089:157"/> was for the Patriarches, Prophets, ApoÅ¿tles, and IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elfe, who was preÅ¿ent at a marriage, and at banquets, and had the fruition of theÅ¿e ordinarie thinges, as well as any other. If any meane thoÅ¿e plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ures which are vnprofitable and Å¿uperfluous, he may be anÅ¿wered, that theÅ¿e pleaÅ¿ures are proper vnto Epicures, &amp; are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mon to brute beaÅ¿ts. If one vnderÅ¿tands carnall pleaÅ¿ures, as to gourmandize, and to be drunken, and to bee riotous in exceÅ¿Å¿e, in which Å¿enÅ¿uall men doo take theyr pleaÅ¿ure, hee may bee aunÅ¿wered, that theÅ¿e bee the pleaÅ¿ures of voluptuous men, and that Å¿uch pleaÅ¿ures be of their owne nature Å¿o filthie, deteÅ¿table, and infamous, that when they are once na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, they ought to bee abhorred, by reaÅ¿on of thoÅ¿e infinite miÅ¿chiefes which they draw after them, without making any mention of the Å¿hame, Å¿orrow, and repentance, which doo ordinarily accompanie them. But lette vs oppoÅ¿e vnto theÅ¿e, that they may conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿e the ioy of the Å¿pirit, which is the true ioy, I mean the vnderÅ¿tanding of the holy Å¿cripture, the meditations of the Å¿ame, the reuelation of the great Å¿ecrets of God:<note place="margin">Rom. 24. Gal. 5.</note> this is the ioy of the holy ghoÅ¿t, of which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> Å¿peaketh, and mention is made in all the worde of GOD. This is the ioy with which the Angels are Å¿atiÅ¿fied, and
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:9089:157"/> reioyce with all the elect and faythfull that may bee, the which is ioy with out co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>pariÅ¿on what can any deÅ¿ire that is greater? and why Å¿houlde any bee leÅ¿Å¿e affectionate,<note place="margin">A confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the obiection of thoÅ¿e that be carefull.</note> to the Å¿tudie of the MiniÅ¿trie, if that hee bee but depriued of thoÅ¿e pleaÅ¿ures which are prophane and vnlawfull. Finally, if another Å¿hall Å¿ay, that hee is kept backe from dedicating of himÅ¿elfe vnto the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿trie, becauÅ¿e that MiniÅ¿ters are Å¿ubiect vnto infinite daungers, we aunÅ¿were, that this is the replie of a coward, and of a faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted man: wee may oppoÅ¿e againÅ¿t this, that princes, gentlemen, Å¿ouldiers, marchants,<note place="margin">ChryÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tome vpon the Å¿econd of Mathew.</note> and euerie condition of men, doo not liue more Å¿afely. The higher that Princes are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted, the more they are aÅ¿Å¿ailed with feare and continuall dangers. Alwaies (Å¿aith <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿oÅ¿tome</hi>) a great Å¿tate is Å¿ubiect to great feare, as the bowes of trees, <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi> higher that they are, the more are they Å¿haken with euery little puffe of wind that bloweth, Å¿o thoÅ¿e that are exalted vnto the top of the greateÅ¿t honors, are often times troubled, &amp; do imagine their eÅ¿tate almoÅ¿t deÅ¿perate, not onely by euerie Å¿mall report of bad newes <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  </hi> may bee brought vnto them, but alÅ¿o they are oftentimes in daily feare of them, which are appointed for the protection of their perÅ¿on. The gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is no leÅ¿Å¿e aÅ¿Å¿ured, neither in peace nor
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:9089:158"/> war. In peace it is moÅ¿t certain, that he muÅ¿t Å¿uffer and indure many paines and troubles, in conuerÅ¿ing with them, with whom hee hath any thing to doo, and this likewiÅ¿e is common to euerie condition of man. In warre, amongÅ¿t the torments of mind which he may haue (if it may be called the torment of the minde) hee muÅ¿t bee readie to finde out his Prince, and to obey in all things that it pleaÅ¿eth him to commaunde him. To be briefe, he muÅ¿t not Å¿tay at his own houÅ¿e, for otherwiÅ¿e hee may bee counted a carter, or one that keepeth the chimnie corner, or els he may fall into Å¿ome other mark of infamie The eÅ¿tate of the Å¿ouldiour is nothing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for hee is compaÅ¿Å¿ed with Å¿o many dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, that euerie houre hee Å¿hall putte his life in hazard, Å¿eeing that hee muÅ¿t Å¿ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time go to the aÅ¿Å¿ault, Å¿ometime to the skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿h, Å¿ometime to the battaile, Å¿ometime to the breach, and many other encounters, which death many times follows hard at the heeles. The Marchant liueth not more Å¿afely, but with more feare and trembling. How dooth hee quake for feare many times, when hee goeth vppe and downe to fayres, is hee not conÅ¿trained to paÅ¿Å¿e through woods and forreÅ¿ts? It Å¿eemeth vnto him, that he alwaies beholdeth theeues and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers after his taile, to rob him of his treaÅ¿ure,
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:9089:158"/> and Å¿ometime to cut his throate, and that not without cauÅ¿e, becauÅ¿e he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>monly Å¿pieth out Å¿uch in his way. Is he in greater Å¿ecuritie vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Å¿ea? The pyrats, and other Å¿pies, lye alwaies in wait to catch him, without making any mention of the tempeÅ¿ts, and Å¿tormye weather, vnto which, they are continually expoÅ¿ed, and are not far from death, but euen the breadth of two ynches, as one of the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loÅ¿ophers hath Å¿aid. To be briefe, euery man, of what art or miÅ¿terie Å¿o euer hee be, is he not Å¿ubiect to many hazards, yea vnto more then the miniÅ¿ters are? becauÅ¿e that they commonly Å¿taying with theyr flocke, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their calling, are in more Å¿afetie then thoÅ¿e that trauaile hither and thither? But if it Å¿o fall out, that they be in daunger when they are with their flocke, in the middeÅ¿t or nigh to the aduerÅ¿aries of the truth, there is none of their faithfull hearers, but that will vÅ¿e all <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi> meanes they can, yea and ve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ter their liues for the preÅ¿eruation of theyr perÅ¿on, as we haue Å¿eene many times in <hi>France,</hi> and in other places, that many haue bin preÅ¿erued by theÅ¿e means. When they are in the army, their vocation is to preach, to aduiÅ¿e, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniÅ¿h, and principally to be neare vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> which do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mand, &amp; not to go &amp; ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> at al en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ters, as captains, &amp; Å¿ouldiers, &amp; other muÅ¿t do, according to their duty, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>Å¿eque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tly, they
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:9089:159"/> are not inuironed with Å¿o many dangers as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men are. Further, propoÅ¿e vnto thy Å¿elf, that if they indure any afflictions, or torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ts of the minde, that it is for the honor of God. And conÅ¿ider that if Princes, Noble men, &amp; Artizans, do Å¿uffer voluntarily an infinit marterdome, one for ambition, the other for couetouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e, an other I know not for what vanities, much more, none ought to feare, or to doubt at all to bee troubled, or to Å¿uffer Å¿hipwracke, euen of life it Å¿elfe, for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement of the glory of God, and for the Å¿aluation of his brethren, which are things Å¿o rare, and Å¿o precious, that the Å¿onne of God doubted not to Å¿hed his bloud for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>. What ioy and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>fort may come vnto them by theÅ¿e Å¿ufferings, for which the ApoÅ¿tles and other of the faithfull reioyced Å¿o much? What man is Å¿o eloquent, that can expreÅ¿Å¿e this in words? But for thy Å¿ouereigne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, Å¿et before thee, that he whom thou Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueÅ¿t, is Å¿trong, &amp; mightie, for to defend thee againÅ¿t any thing that may happen: who is thy rocke, thy buckler, thy Tower, and who will neuer forÅ¿ake thee in time of need. God Å¿aith by his Prophet,<note place="margin">Zach. 2</note> 
                  <hi>That he that toucheth the faithfull, toucheth the apple of his eie.</hi> Hee Å¿peaketh this of all the faithfull in generall: how much more then, doth hee vnderÅ¿tand the PaÅ¿tors, whome he hath ordained to be
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:9089:159"/> guides vnto others. In mans body there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that we do Å¿o charily regarde, as the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the eye, becauÅ¿e that is the guide of the other members. If then the PaÅ¿tors bee the apples of the eies of God, that is, thoÅ¿e whom he loueth, and keepeth as his onely treaÅ¿ure, who doubteth, but that he hath more care in preÅ¿eruing them, then wee haue in keeping our Å¿ight? To conclude, if any man oppoÅ¿eth whatÅ¿oeuer he can, or what hee may deuiÅ¿e or inuent, as obÅ¿tacles and hinderaunces to diÅ¿Å¿wade any from the loue of the miniÅ¿terie of the word of God: we know alÅ¿o that there are Å¿ufficient aunÅ¿wers to confute him, and which are of more force by the grace of God to inflame them that haue any heart at all (if they can vnderÅ¿tand them) that no reaÅ¿ons can be alleaged to diÅ¿courage them. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, let vs beÅ¿eech the Lorde God, with an ardent heart, and deuout minde, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the miniÅ¿terie is a diuine and Å¿pirituall thing, and men by nature Å¿enÅ¿uall, and giuen vnto the world, that it would pleaÅ¿e him by vertue of the holy GhoÅ¿t, to roote out of diuers mens hearts, theÅ¿e carnall and wordly affections, and plant, and as it were imprint in them, a holy deÅ¿ire of applying themÅ¿elues moÅ¿t earneÅ¿tly vnto this holy vocation: that he would vouchÅ¿afe, to inflame our hearts more and more, with the fire of his holy Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,

Finally, that he would direct and guide them, that they may be able to finiÅ¿h and accompliÅ¿h theyr courÅ¿es, in Å¿uch Å¿ort, that the efficacie and power thereof, may redounde vnto the reÅ¿toring of many Kingdomes vnto ChriÅ¿t, yea euen vnto the renewing of the face of the whole earth, the whole being done for the Å¿ingular comfort of the faithful, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally, for the aduancement of Gods glory: to whome bee all honour, praiÅ¿e and glory, both now and euermore. <hi>Amen.</hi>
